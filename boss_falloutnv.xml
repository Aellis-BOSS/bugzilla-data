The Strip Open is an attempt to restore the Vegas Strip worldspace in Fallout: New Vegas to what was the developer&apos;s original intent; namely a large, visually spectacular open area. The Strip as found in the retail game is not the original plan for the area, and the checkpoint gates that make the area so clumsy to navigate are sadly a technical compromise - to quote Obsidian lead designer J.E Sawyer: &quot;Memory problems caused crashing in both The Strip and Freeside, so they had to be split up&quot;. As you might expect, for these very reasons this mod is more demanding than the vanilla game, so users with lower end machines should tread with caution. The Strip Open should however run comfortably on most modern computers.
This mod is not an attempt to remodel or revamp the strip or to add new locations. There are many other mods with this goal, and users are encouraged to explore other options if that is their desire. The primary goal of The Strip Open is simply to recreate Obsidian&apos;s original vision for the strip, and to ensure the core game still has complete functionality despite these substantial changes.</thetext>

Is is similiar to &apos;New Vegas Uncut - Freeside Open&apos; in that it not only combines all different Strip worldspaces, but also restores cut content. Therefore (I think) it should probably be placed somewhere near FreesideOpenPatch.esp. But that is just my guess.</thetext>

Version 1.2 (Works better for me than 1.4)
Checksum: 8D871848
From the readme:
&quot;Ensure that the file NVStripOpen.esm is higher in the load order than StripOpenMain.esp, e.g.
NVStripOpen.esm
StripOpenMain.esp&quot;
I have it loaded after the compiled patch esp&apos;s, seems to work better for me that way, YMMV.</thetext>

This small Mod changes the way you access your Lucky 38 suite by planting a Map-Marker in front of the main-entrance and by connecting the said entrance directly with the elevator of your Lucky 38 suite. So you can fast travel to Lucky 38 and directly jump into your player-home without needing to walk through the casino floor.</thetext>

I created this file due to episodes of groups of 5 merchants getting blasted by a single recruit legionnary, for instance, when using AWOP with Project Nevada rebalance module. Since PN does not alter base hitpoints, most AWOP NPCs have values around 200 on the wastes, which can create imbalance IMO (your max HP with PN is 230 with 10 END and Life Giver). I didn\&apos;t change their SPECIALs, so they\&apos;ll still be able to kick you around if unwary. For instance, veteran NCR rangers have SPECIALs around 5-6, while AWOP adds SpecOps veterans which had 3x base HP and SPECIALS around 8-10. Now they have the same base HP as normal veteran Rangers but high stats, which means they\&apos;ll still be tougher than you, hit harder than you and better than you. Of course, Underground characters are still way worse and will shred you as easily as they could do in vanilla AWOP.
Probable conflicts: 
I made the mod using the LowLootMWeapons patch. Might alter the inventories, don\&apos;t know for sure. Since the edits were done to base HP, will conflict with any mod that alters AWOP-added NPCs.
Should be compatible with LowNPCs and DeadMoney AWOP patches. Can\&apos;t say ot others.
Notes: 
Actually, the .esp does not require PN-Rebalance module to be loaded before it. However, it is reccomended since i made the changes with the alternate hitpoint system in mind. Only use it without PN if you think AWOP NPCs are too OP. Links to Project Nevada and A World of Pain are in the Required Files and Credits section.</thetext>

[size=15]Introduction? (Is this needed?!)[/size]
Hello all :DDD  this is an attempt 
at modding/editing/testing.. out of basically... the tutorial given by
--&gt;Bouncing Breasts Type 3 Armors -(author :revanag)
Currently, the animation should work fine, and it\&apos;s utterly amazing :D, i used a Type 3 body/Cali as a reference in Nifskope, but in general, unless your character has over-sized breasts, there shouldn\&apos;t be clipping. The only complaint ..was perhaps the costume\&apos;s orignal meshes,  offered little room (it\&apos;s highly due to my low-level newbie skills)
NOTE: I only offer bouncing animations towards the clothing...
[size=8]Currently Available [/size]
1)Asuka Armor MKIV
2)Babydoll Costume
[size=15]Requirements[/size]
As this mod adds breast animation.. it is fundamental that you should by chance already is :D
1)A Bouncing Breasts fan!  (Installed [u]Meshes folder from BNB_Body package from Bouncing Natural Breasts mod[/u]) 
Link : http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35047
[size=5]Okay!.. right basically, it\&apos;s this , once you copy the meshes folder from BnB_body , simply download any Type 3 Body files and copy the following contents above it[/size]
[size=15]Installation[/size]
Basically, you will need to simply :
1) Open package in 7-zip/WinRar
2)Copy files to \\New Vegas\\Data\\ folder.
(Note: if anyone is wondering..why is it so big? since it\&apos;s just a mesh change , i added the modified meshes into the original package and uploaded it together .. so it\&apos;s simply \&quot;Drag &amp; Drop\&quot;)
[size=15]Requests?![/size]
Bwaha! :D  do drop by with requests.. on other costumes if possible, i can attempt to make them bouncing!...

adventure
The Geshute tribe have grown rich through the slave trade. They are taking full advantage of the undefended NCR southern border region to raid farther north than ever before. Its time to take the fight to them. Their stronghold is located in the Badlands, on the old Geshute Indian reservation.
Badlands is a new worldspace with several new areas to explore. It was designed to challange a high level character so you had better come prepared. The mod begins with a message to investigate the ambush of a caravan north of Goodsprings. Talk with the survivor and this will lead you to the Badlands entrance. I had loads of fun play testing this.</thetext>

KNOWN ISSUES:
Sometimes you can start with no weapons, or no clothing. Simply reload the autosave to re-generate everything.
Occasionally a character will be given two of the same type of weapon, as a side arm and primary weapon. Use one to repair the other :)
Due to the fact that this mod starts you out outside of Doc Mitchell&apos;s house, the DLC will consider your game started, resulting in their pop-ups ruining your start experience. I suggest you get a mod like Delay DLC to get around this.
Ed-E might disappear in existing saves. The reason is currently unknown, but is being looked into.
Not having NVSE will cause manifest in the Race menu not showing up when activated from the Terminal. And you will be unable to leave the shack. This is not a bug, you don&apos;t meet the requirements.
Existing characters made prioer to 1.5 that have Reduced Sneak, Reduced Science, or Reduced Medicine will need to start over or do player.restoreav medicine/sneak/science 9999999 to get the stat fixed.
Please report any other issues you come across, so they can be fixed or added here.
INCOMPATIBILITIES:
NVEC alters parts of Quest VCG01, the same quest that Alt Start makes major edits to. Load Alt Start after NVEC, or just don&apos;t activate NVEC until you finish character creation and leave the start shack. Once past the start shack, VCG01 is finished and no longer running. Any conflicts will not matter then.
Any other mod that edits Quest VCG01. This is unavoidable in the design of Alt Start, and cannot be fixed without a patch file.
Probably TTW/RFCW. I&apos;m not sure how they handle the game start anymore, though I do have TTW and plan on testing with it soon. Expect a patch at some point after that happens.</thetext>

Welcome to \&quot;Angel Valley\&quot; 
          Come and explore a new world away from the sands of the Mojave
            Visit the quiet little town of Angel Park and maybe take a hike through the 
       lovely surrounding wilderness, just remember to not feed the local wildlife
  with yourself........

TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   This mod is an ever expanding \&quot;New World Space\&quot; that myself and Djmystro plan to keep
adding to with quests and NPC\&apos;s that will keep the place fun to come back to.
   This the second version and contains many new interior and exterior areas, plus new creatures and weapons.
       Dj will have in time an esp that will compliment this by adding more history
 and many changes to the mod such as weapon variations, faction changes, and even some
area changes and creatures to keep it fun to come back
  I plan to continue to add more creatures, weapons and world space to explore in the 
 master file

TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
 Heres what you will find:
[img]http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/5963/57775926.jpg[/img]
      46 playable, some have custom ammo, 8 types so far that can be crafted using new 
alien tech called \&quot;Nanites\&quot;. All custom ammo have varied effects that reduce the damage
threshold or increase accuracy to name a few, different ammo for different enemies.
Many weapons have new sounds, projectiles, explosions, ammo, muzzleflash, and some have
 their own special critical death that is unique to that weapon so no need to worry about
it conflicting with other effects mods such as EVE
[img]http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6383/img5h.jpg[/img]
 11 types of armor that include aliens, droids and a new type of armor that can be 
crafted with \&quot;Nanites\&quot; called Reactive Armor, this armor adds different types of stat
boosts depending on the type of armor you craft.
  Give a suit of Alien armor to a companion and you will be the envy of all back at the
Mojave  (or they\&apos;ll start shootin at ya) 
[img]http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/2012/img6iy.jpg[/img]
 And lots of them, many have new items, ever wonder what Khazra meat tastes like?
well cut off a big steak and fire up the grill. Xenos have concentrated acid blood that 
can be used to craft grenades that will melt your enemies and leave a half dissolved
smoking skeleton (no joke) and many more
[img]http://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9422/83042162.jpg[/img]
   Vast underground network of tunnels and bunkers, some have fallen into ruin and 
only the bravest, or foolish venture there. Traps and terrible things lurk in the darkness.
To complete the mood setting, actual music from both Terminator and Alien movies are 
played in certain danger zone areas.
[img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/2173/stalkerguns.jpg[/img]
  New Stalker weapons have been added, they can be found hidden about the valley or some of the local population may have some..
                     pointed at you
also 2 vanilla weapon mesh and texture edits that do not overwrite the guns in game, they are found only here
(see screenshots)

DJ MYSTRO’S “ANGEL PARK REMIX” 
DESCRIPTION:
The Remix mod heavily modifies Angel Park to be more of a cluttered and story-driven exploration experience.
-Many locations heavily modified, many completely re-arranged for an entirely new combat/search experience. Basically several of the original interiors were very close copies of pre-existing areas. Personally I am not happy playing through anything I recognise so one aim of this mod is to take anything that looks too familiar and totally re-arrange it. Also a few areas were lacking in reward loot and only offer a fight so I\&apos;m trying to balance both. 
-Some extensions built onto a few smaller cave areas.
-Enemies are changed to reflect the Collector\&apos;s (main story character) Ship contents more accurately. 
-Alien Ammo Damage modifiers are much more deadly in the Remix. However you must find the relevant schematics and misc items in order to be able to craft them. Many schematics are difficult to find but if you are impatiant there is a new Starter Box option to get them all on arrival. Each ammo has a corresponding misc item, (e.g 308AM = Fission Batteries, 9mmCI = Ashtrays, 12.7mmITS = Scrap Electronics etc...). This makes a big difference to the search and loot aspect and I have spent a lot of time balancing the remix for this
-Each creature type has been added to their own faction group so they fight each other (mostly). They also guard their own conquered territory but can easily be led into battles with each other. 
-Many notes moved, changed and added back in after everything was moved to the new worldspace. This includes many of the Collector\&apos;s notes and totally re-writes some notes that will not make much sense after the conversion (from a long time ago when AP had a different Worldspace). 
-Friendly NCR Turrets back. 3 friendly turrets now guard the entrance for a little hackable backup and that extra Aliens \&apos;B-Guns down\&apos; vibe. 
-Total overhaul of exterior enemies around Angel Park. Don\&apos;t expect to run into any Brahmin or cats out there. They will have been killed long ago. There are less enemies overall but the enemies that are left are very tough. 
-About 30% more Nanites. They will not be craftable (yet) but there are currently approximately 160 individual jars spread around to find plus random spawns on certain creatures. 
-Weapon stat overhaul. All weapons rebalanced where needed. Many are now much more powerful. 
-Loot rebalance - you will only find one of each new weapon lying around in Angel Park, though most will still be spawning on enemies as well. Reductions in ammo and other loot (such as grenades) too. No weapons or armor will be found at 100% condition if I can help it. 
-Weapons lists will now include vanilla weapons that the enemies have salvaged from the previous occupants of the valley. 
-Ammo lists fixed via scripts so Xcaliber ammo can be used alongside the new alien ammo variants and Alien Ammo works in vanilla guns. 
-4x 4D Storage devices available to find. 
-Adds several map markers. 
-Adds a new Campsite with it\&apos;s own Map Marker outside the Wasteland Entrance by Rauls Shack which starts the first of several story chains. 
-Starter Box added to inner NCR camp. Begin your game with a choice of M4A1, Hammer, Black Death or any one of up to 9 options to help tip the odds a little more in your favour (limited loadout and Schematics loadouts available). 
-New ammo - Only 1 so far - 12 Gauge Sticky Explosive, but should be a lot of fun :) 
-Lots of other minor fixes and alterations (too many to list). 
INSTALLATION:
*You NEED ALL these mods (loaded in this order) to use this file*:
MoMod.esm (aka Monster Mod)
Angel Park.esm
AngelParkRemix.esp
WARNING:
Updating an existing save game in Angel Park will cause a *lot* of problems. This esp effects near enough everything so to be properly experienced should be played from a game saved before entering the Valley.
BUGS:
-Reappearing Creatures such as Brahmin and Dogs which were removed but sometimes spawn when exiting to a certain place.
-Currently no delay on Explosive Sticky ammo.
CREDITS:
Same as original.
AMMO ACTIVATION:
You have to activate the alien ammo by walking through an invisible trigger. There are 2, one inside Doc Mitchell\&apos;s house and one outside the entrance door to Angel Valley. If you are entering the valley for the first time you can\&apos;t not go through it.
You can then use ammo you find laying around but you will still need to find the recipices to make them in this version.
CHANGE LOG:
Version 2.11:
- Rebalances new Weapons.
- Reclutters several locations.
- Adds lots more map markers.
2.1:
-Added lots more map markers.
-Fixed several aesthetic issues.
-Re-arms Tech Alien Elders so hopefully they put up a fight (have not had chance to test yet).
-Moves a few wasteland NPCs about.
-Fixed the School Basement Hatch door being blocked by clutter
-Removes some common loot items and replaces them with crafting materials (including a dozen or so more Nanites in easy to spot areas).
-Altered some 100% condition weapon spawns to lower condition values.
Big thanks to Dogtown for laying out such an awesome playing field (not to mention loads of cool stuff to populate it with).

[font=palatino linotype][center][size=4][color=orange]DEMONESS HAIRS[/color][/size]
VERY IMPORTANT!!!! To add to custom races READ THIS!!!! CORRISPONDENCE hair mesh and texture:
Hair.nif&gt;&gt;FH18.dds
Hair2.nif&gt;&gt;FH5.dds
Hair3.nif&gt;&gt;FH10.dds
Hair11.nif&gt;&gt;FH16.dds
This mods add 7 hairs from demoness mod to non custom-race female.But you can add them to custom races too.It\&apos;s very simple.
How to add hairs to Custom races.You will need a beauty mod like ling\&apos;s coiffeur,or Mikoto,and add to that(if the race is compatible with your beauty mod.In that case i opened the geck,loaded ONLY ling.esm,whitout active files,and changed the meshes/textures of certain female hairs i didn\&apos;t like to mine)
You can also add the hair to custom races by using the geck,and add new hairs:character&gt;hair&gt;New...
Hope you will enjoy!

Arwen&apos;s NV Realism Tweaks:
Version: 5.0 - October 30, 2013
My Fallout New Vegas Gameplay Overhaul, focused on making the game play much more realistic, more challenging, and more balanced. These are changes that I created for my own game, which were designed to complement the other mods that I&apos;m using, which are all covered at my Fallout New Vegas Mod List.
Requires New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE).
Here are the major changes in v.5.0 (10/30/13):
    This is a Major update that further improves game play balance (especially at higher levels), fix minor bugs, and adds some new features. Many of my scripts were edited to work better together, which greatly improved the optimization of my Full mod.
    Version 5.0 has been restructured and includes so many changes that it requires that you begin a new game (even it you are using an earlier version of my Tweaks).
    The Realism Core now also includes my former Hard-Core and Endurance modules, merged into a single, optimized core module.
    Expanded Options Menu. Now includes disable/enable Strain, select between More/Less Difficult Hard-Core settings, toggle One Life on/off, alter your character&apos;s height, select between more/less Weapon Ability Penalty messages, and increase/decrease the chances of Dismemberment.
    The &quot;Realism Tweaks User Guide&quot; Word doc has been expanded and updated to version 5.0.
    Realism Core changes:
    Health Points: Adjusted for both PC and NPCs, to keep the game challenging at high Endurance, but also so that you wouldn&apos;t die quite so easily at lower END (which was often a problem when my One Life module was active).
    Threshold Resistance: Set to game default 20%, and is now adjustable from 0 to 40%. Damage Threshold was also increased for some creatures.
    Tougher NPCs (now under VisualFXs, in Options Menu): my default setting is &quot;Normal NPCs,&quot; which still have 20% more HPs than in the default game (the &quot;Tougher NPCs&quot; setting should ONLY be used if you find that the NPCs are too easy to kill).
    Fatigue script rewritten: passout/revival imods now works smoother and fatigue changes are better integrated across all modules.
    Weapon Effects: Improved to mesh better with my latest changes to Fatigue and Armor Level (see Med-Tec changes).
    Weapon Ability Penalties: script better optimized and Penalties have been completely rebalanced (every perk has been redone). No strength penalty with range weapons when you are receiving a skill penalty; and no skill penalty with melee weapons when you are receiving a strength penalty. I also increased VATS and Critical Chance/DAM reductions, and decreased Weapon Dam reductions in my low weapon skill and strength perks. Unarmed has now been added to my Weapon Abilities.
    Dynamic Stealth: your enemies will not be able to see you from so far away; you will now be much less visible when crouching than when you are standing; and your Perception now increases by 1 point when you are sneaking (only when your Health is greater than 50%).
    Pip-Boy Locked during Combat: Once the &quot;No Pip-Boy during combat&quot; message is displayed, your Pip-Boy only remains locked for 30 seconds, even if you are still flagged as being in combat, but your weapon must remain holstered and you must remain in Sneak mode. (Gives you a chance to put on a helmet or bandage a wound while your enemy is still searching for you.)
    Repair: Made some minor changes that now permit you to repair some weapons and armor with other weapons and armor. Also rewrote my Repair script, so that your Intelligence stat has more of an impact on your Self-Repair ability (also gender-based).
    New Rookie Penalties: Option added at end of Hard-Core Quest (now part of Realism Core), which will initially make your game VERY difficult. If selected, your initial SPECIALs are reduced to a minimal amount (based on your stats), and your character will actually have put their skills and muscles to use for their stats to slowly increase back to the non-penalized amounts. Most Rookie Penalties will last for at least a couple of game days, but could last for much longer, depending on how you progress. When my Weapon Ability Penalties are also enabled, you will be able to use most weapons, even when your skills are very low (until Rookie Penalties are no longer being applied).
    You now only receive 7 Skill points to distribute at Level Up (was 8 points in v.4.1; default is 13 points). But your Tagged Skills still receive my 2X multiplier with odd level ups.
    Med-Tec changes:
    Needs and Injuries have been rebalanced quite a bit. Bandages are a bit more effective at treating Wounds, and Stimpaks now increase clotting effect, even with the Stimpak hotkey. Plus both Bandages and Stimpaks will now reduce your Infection Level a bit, but only before the Wound has become badly infected (Level 6+).
    Improved Sleep Quest Script: Your HPs will no longer drop more than 10% while sleeping. Slower healing while sleeping or waiting than while awake. [This removes the sleep/wait cheat, where sleeping/waiting for a few hours could completely heal most of your injuries.]
    Armor Level now increases faster at lower DT, and slows down as DT increases, and there are now 12 Levels (were 10). The difference now between 1DT and 11DT is a +5 Armor Level increase, while the difference between 24DT and 34DT is only a +2 Armor Level increase. Wearing Power Armor (when your DT is greater than 23) now gives an Armor Level bonus. A brief message is now displayed whenever your Armor Level changes.
    Weapon Injury Script: the balance between your Armor Level and weapon hit injuries was improved. Bullet weapon hits were split into two separate form lists ... High DAM and Low DAM. New Creature Hits form list: Bloatfly darts, Ant spit, and Centaur spit now increase your Wound Level. When my default &quot;More Difficult Hard-Core&quot; is enabled, a percentage of your HPs are now also damaged by this script (for both types of bullet hits, for creature hits, and for cutting and trauma injuries); with 1 AL (2 DT) a single High-DAM bullet will damage your HP at least 60%; with 6 AL (15 DT) the HP damage is reduced to 30%.
    Reduced the amount that Wound Level immediately increases when your Wounds become badly Infected.
    Number of bandages available was added to the Wound Treatment message.
    Your drawn weapon is now holstered before you do Full Scan or do a Hotkey Stimpak injection (prevents animation issues).
    You Need 25% more Water per hour when your Encumbrance is greater than 70% (except while you are sleeping/waiting).
    Drinking from a pure water source now reduces your Water Need by 4 oz (was 2), Bacteria Level still only increases +1 for each drink.
    Any water bottle can now be filled at both Purified and Good water sources. Pure or Good water bottles both yield a bottle of Good water, at either source (since the bottle is used). A Dirty water bottle always yields a bottle of Dirty water (from any source, since the bottle is dirty).
    Drinking water when you have Radiation Sickness or Food Poisoning will no longer quench your thirst, but now increases you Water Need by +0.5 (due to dehydration effect when getting sick).
    You now have the option of drinking bottled water while in the Med-Tec scan menu. Added new Needs Menu (replaces the &quot;Additional Stats&quot; menu): similar to my Bottle Water menu, where your Bacteria, Digestion, and Radiation Levels are shown (along with 6 other stats). This should lessen your chances of Food Poisoning (by drinking from water bottles when your Bacteria Level was too high).
    Added drinking animations to all bottled water (similar to my stimpak and bandage animations, where you&apos;ll not be able to use a weapon until the animation ends). The standing animation only lasts a few seconds (and you can still walk and run). The sitting animations last quite a bit longer and may be a bit off when sitting in some chair types (as these are the unaltered default animations).
    The Needs menu also gives the maximum Food Units you can safely eat (based on your current Bacteria, Radiation, and Digestion Levels). If you pay attention to this and never eat food that has more Food Units than your current safe maximum amount, you should never get sick from eating too much. You must leave the Needs Menu to eat anything, but you have the option of opening your PipBoy directly from the menu.
    One Life changes:
    The scripts are now MUCH improved and should now remain stable, even after you&apos;ve been using One Life in your game for a while. The respawn points are now disabled after use, and then deleted after you quit each game session.
    One Life is initially enabled (at the end of the One Life Quest), and you can now disable (and enable) it at any time [Options Menu/Other Settings]. After disabling, you should delete all the OneLife saves and save your game manually. [For best results: quit your game, start again by loading your manual save, and make a new save soon after the game has fully loaded. This ensures that all the Revival Markers have been removed from your future saves.]
    Less chance now of being attacked when you are unconscious (which often happened just before you revived,while your Fatigue was still above 100%).
    You are now looted of 50% to 90% of your caps, based on your Luck stat (was always 90% of your caps).
    After Near Death player’s armor is now removed and returned to inventory (prevents coming to in a different armor than what you &quot;died&quot; in). Player now holds onto their equipped weapon (instead of the weapon returning to their inventory), and your ammo is now only looted if you have more than 10 ammo for your equipped weapon.
    If you suffer a Near Death with poison still in your system, there is now a chance you might survive.
    When Rookie Penalties are enabled and you also have less than 4 Endurance: Near Death will be triggered when your HPs drop below 20 points; and your Med-Tec injuries will not increase as much when you are revived. Once Rookie Penalties have all been removed, or your Endurance is higher than 3, the Near Death trigger and Med-Tec injuries at revival will revert back to normal.
    New optional One Life - Lite esp (if my regular One Life module seems to increase your CTDs). The &quot;Lite&quot; version has pretty much the same Normal Death and Near Death penalties as the regular version; the main difference is the way Near Death revives the player. In the Lite version you are not moved, but are revived right where you died. Unfortunately this means that your enemies may still be waiting for you, which may result in you dying again (probably a Normal Death this time). Also your Normal Death revival locations are MUCH less random than with the regular version. So this is definitely a lite version, but it should work for all users without increasing their game CTDs.
    Camera module changes:
    Moved the 3rd person viewpoint in a bit closer (to the PC) and a little lower, to improve perspective and aiming a bit while in 3rd person.
Description and Concept:
    My goal has always been to make FONV more immersive and more realistic within the context of Fallout&apos;s alternate reality (which is a place where radiation causes mutations as often as death, and where injuries can be healed with a stimpack injection).
    The Fallout games are RPGs, but I felt that FONV&apos;s role-playing aspects were rather weak in many areas. For me, a Role-Playing Game is more realistic when I can role-play without having to work at it. I have a great imagination, but I wanted the game itself to impose some real consequences and limitations on my character, instead of just pretending that these things existed. My goal was to do this in a way that made the game more challenging.
    With my Tweaks installed, your Skills and Stats now become much more important in how your game will play out. You will also discover that your distribution of SPECIAL points is now MUCH more important than it was in the default game. And installing my Med-Tec and One Life modules will make this harsher game world an even more challenging place. You will now find that the Mojave Desert may actually feel like a harsh wasteland. You may also discover that the game is now a lot more fun. My Realism Tweaks is a Fallout New Vegas overhaul, so it makes some rather dramatic changes to the game (changes roughly 2200 records and includes over 100 custom scripts).
    Do NOT install this mod unless you want the Mojave to be a harsher place where you will have to struggle just to survive.
    My Realism Core&apos;s tweaks are mostly activated at the very beginning of the game (or whenever you install and active it). But the mod does not fully kick in until after you exit Doc&apos;s home, and you my Realism Tweaks message is displayed [My Encumbrance and Hard-Core quests will be begin soon after the Realism Core quest has finished; along with the quests in any of my optional modules.]
    IMPORTANT: This mod was balanced for NORMAL Difficulty. Using a Hard or Very Hard difficulty setting will just make the NPCs and Creatures even more difficult to kill (it will take more bullets), and your character will even be easier to kill. My Realism Tweaks already does both, so you will just be multiplying these two things, which will likely have negative effects.
    Please do no make requests that I remove my skill damage increases, as that is totally contrary to my goal of making Fallout NV a better RPG. One of the main elements of a RPG has always been that the amount of damage you do is ALWAYS determined by your skill level. Remove that, and you pretty much negate any reason to ever advance your skills. The way my mod handles weapon skill is that you gain a weapon damage BONUS as your weapon skills increase. This is just like the way that Perks give you bonuses. Even at 10 Skill, DAM is 60% greater than default. In the default game, any weapon that you use will not do its full DAM until your weapon skill (for that type of weapon) is at 100 (100%). With my Tweaks, a weapon will do its full DAM once your weapon skill reaches 20 (above 20 skill, the DAM will continue to increase, reaching a 2x DAM BONUS at 100 skill).
CORE MASTER and REALISM CORE MODULE:
    My Realism Tweaks makes more changes and is way more complex, than I can possibly cover here. The full details on all my changes are listed in the Realism Tweaks section my Fallout New Vegas Journal..
    My Realism Tweaks are meant to be used together, so my FULL Tweaks are only experienced when you install my Core Master esm and the three main modules (and enable all the recommended settings in my Options Menu).
    The Core Master (Arwen_NV_Core.esm) and Realism Core module Arwen_NV_Realism_Core.esp) are mandatory! The other modules are optional.
    Note: My Fatigue and Strain HUD meters will not be displayed unless you follow my HUD Setup instructions exactly.
REALISM CORE QUEST (and core changes):
    Begins shortly after you exit Doc&apos;s house, and finishes when my pop-up welcome message is displayed.
    [Arwen&apos;s Option Menu]: in-game selection of many features and settings that enable you to customize how my mod affects your game play.
    Timescale Settings [adjustable]: a special script enables slower Timescales with the game&apos;s hardcore mode [or with my Med-Tec Needs]; and your Needs now increase at much more realistic rates..
    Dynamic Timescale [optional]: Timescale will be 50% slower in interior cells, during combat, or when your health is less than 25%.
    Menu Time [adjustable]: The game clock no longer stops while in most menus.
    XPR Multiplier [adjustable] slows down how fast you level up by globally reducing ALL future experience points rewards.
    Greatly Reduced Carrying Capacity, which is now gender based (unless you are using the &quot;Less Difficult Hard-Core&quot; setting).
    More realistic walking and running speeds. RunBack effect slows down your speed when running backward (Agility based). Reduced safe fall height distance to 14 feet. Increased Crippled Speed Penalties when walking or running with a crippled leg.
    Your character&apos;s Health Points were reduced from default game&apos;s Level 1 amounts, and you no longer gain HPs when you level up. NPC&apos;s HPs were rebalanced over all levels.
    More immersive and balanced VATS, with new Action Points formula (with Agility being a greater factor).
    Smarter AI: combat with NPCs is now much more challenging, and you will be hunted down more diligently.
    Dynamic Stealth: factors in time of day, weather conditions, interior/exterior cell type, player&apos;s Sneak skill, and the player&apos;s actions.
    Implant Regen (used by Implant Regen Perk) is now based on Game Time, instead of on Real Time.
    Your character starts out a bit weaker and more vulnerable; while the NPCs are stronger and healthier, with better armor and weapons across all levels.
    Pain has greater effect on player; swimming or wading in radioactive water is MUCH more deadly; Burns continue to damage HPs after the flames stop and damage Agility; Poisons do more HP damage, over a longer duration, and also damage Agility.
    Localized Damage: strategic hits are more effective (such as crippling shots), and head shots now do a LOT more damage.
    Increased Weapon Skill DAM multiplier (a Bonus multiplier, not a penalty reduction) increases weapon damage up to 2x.
    Rebalanced ALL default Weapons: underpowered weapons were improved and overpowered weapons were reduced in DAM/sec. Skill and weight requirements were generally increased.
    Condition of ranged weapons have more effect on their DAM; damaged weapons will not fire as fast, and have greater chance of jamming; automatic Weapons take longer to cool down.
    Removed the zoomed-in view when aiming most non-scoped pistols (and a couple of the rifles), but scopes added with mod kits will still zoom correctly.
    Weapon Ability Penalties (optional): you are much less effective when your skills are lower than a weapon&apos;s skill requirement, or when your Strength is lower than a weapon&apos;s strength requirement. If your stats are too low, you will not even be able to use some weapons.
    Tougher Crippled Arm Penalties (optional): when an arm is crippled, your Strength and Weapon Skills are reduced and you cannot use VATS. Penalties are greater for a crippled right arm than for a left arm, and even greater when both arms are crippled. But does not directly prevent you from using any weapon.
    Skill Based Accuracy (optional): aiming accuracy is based on your Guns or Energy Weapon skill (also dynamically improves Auto-Aim, as your weapon skill increase).
    PipBoy Locked during Combat (optional): No more combat timeouts to change into better armor, repair weapons, or take a lunch/beverage break.
    Unique Weapon Effects (optional): Gunshot knock downs, Whack and Blast knockouts, which are based on your Armor Level.
    Armor Level is based on your Damage Threshold (DT), but is calculated in a script, and is less linear (increases faster at lower DT, and slows down as DT increases).
    Fatigue HUD, displays fatigue as a percentage (how fatigued you are). When you reach 100% fatigue, you pass out.
    Unique Visual FXs (optional): when wearing sunglasses and reading glasses, and for loss of AGL and PER.
    More realistic explosions, projectiles, grenade physics, and death force effects. Spent shells now last 4 game hours.
    Balanced armor/clothing values, weight (weighs 50% less when worn), damage threshold, and &quot;enchanted&quot; effects. Helmet AR now equals 25% of total armor AR.
    Enhanced repair lists for both weapons and armor.
    More Caps for Merchants - all merchants now have twice as many caps (Wasteland currency).
ENCUMBRANCE QUEST (and changes): (part of Realism Core):
    You now suffer from Strain (similar to fatigue, which increases when walking with more than 100% encumbrance, and whenever you are running at any encumbrance. Strain is based on game time, so Strain increases faster with faster Timescales.
    HUD Strain display (see my Strain HUD Setup instructions): Your Strain percentage will turn red when your Strain reaches 70%, and at 85% Strain the text will start flashing.
    When your Strain is over 50%, your character will start breathing hard; at 75% Strain your character will breath harder (integrated with my Fatigue breathing SoundFX).
    The more encumbered you are, the shorter distance you will be able to travel, and the more you will hurt yourself if you collapse.
    Your current Health is factored into your Strain increase rate, and jumping and swinging a weapon will both increase Strain.
    If your Strain reaches 100%, you will collapse, injure yourself, and your equipped weapon will return to your inventory.
    Using Jet or Ultra Jet will immediately clear your Strain, which can be a lifesaver during combat.
    Strain decreases when you are not in combat, and you stop running, or stop walking with over 100% encumbrance, and while you are in menus (50% slower).
    Dynamic movement speeds: the more you are encumbered, the slower you move. You also gain a running speed bonus when your encumbrance is low, as long as you are in fairly good health. As Strain increases above 70%, your running speed will progressively begin to slow down (since you are getting tired), but the speed that your Strain increases will also slow down (since you are exerting yourself less).
    FastRun: when your Strain is less than 70%, holding down the Activate key while running gives a 50% speed increase, but your Strain will increase 5 times as fast. You will not be able to FastRun if either leg is crippled. If your weapon is out, your speed will be a bit slower (just like with normal running). If crouching, FastRun will automatically make you stand up and FastRun.
    Dynamic Jump: based on your Agility and Encumbrance. You will not be able to jump when your AGL is really low, when you are over-encumbered, or when a leg is crippled.
    My Encumbrance notes are also added to your inventory, for easy reference.
HARD-CORE QUEST (and changes): (part of Realism Core):
    This quest begins about 1 minute after the Med-Tec Quest has finished (or about 1 minute after the Encumbrance Quest has finished, if my Med-Tec module is not installed).
    You now receive less points to distribute in your SPECIALs, with about half as many skill points at Level 1, which will increase roughly half as fast.
    IMPORTANT! Your stats will affect your gameplay quite differently with my Realism Tweaks. Before you distribute your points, I strongly suggest that read my &quot;Realism Tweaks User Guide.doc&quot; (in Fallout New Vegas\Data) and/or the &quot;Hard-Core Quest and Settings Details&quot; page on my website: http://arwenevecom.ipage.com/FalloutNV/Arwens_NV_Hard-Core.htm
    When beginning a new game, or when loading a saved game in which you are still at level 1 or 2, my Hard-Core Quest will reset your number of SPECIAL points to 35; plus you will have to select your Tagged Skills and Traits again.
    Added 7 new Traits: 4 are Fallout 2 Traits (one of which I changed quite a bit) and 3 are my own unique Traits. There are only 11 Traits in the original game, and not all of them worked well with my Tweaks. My new Traits were picked/designed to expand character build diversity, in a way that will have a major effect on your game play (especially early in the game). I also changed the Small Frame Trait, to match the FO2 version (my mod already made it easier to get crippled limbs).
    Rookie Penalties: Option added at end of Hard-Core Quest, which will initially make your game VERY difficult. If selected, your initial SPECIALs are reduced to a minimal amount (based on your stats), and your character will actually have put their skills and muscles to use for their stats to slowly increase back to the non-penalized amounts. Most Rookie Penalties will last for at least a couple of game days, but could last for much longer, depending on how you progress. When my Weapon Ability Penalties are also enabled, you can still use most weapons, even when your skills are very low (until Rookie Penalties are no longer being applied).
    Levelling up: You now receive 6 fewer skill points to distribute when you level up, but your Tagged skills now receive a 2X bonus on Odd Level Ups (Level 3, 5, 7, etc.), when they gain 2 points for every skill point spent on them (my tagged bonus is now spread over many levels, instead of getting it all in Level 1). You now select a Perk at each level up. All 88 Regular Perks, a few Challenger Perks, and half the Companion Perks were modified. I also added a few of my own unique perks (especially for lower-skilled characters), since perk requirements were generally increased.
    Skill Books are not &quot;consumed,&quot; but are now replaced with a Read version. You now gain just 2 points from each Skill book that you read (3 points with the Educated Perk).
    Skill Magazines only give +5 skill points for 90 seconds (180 seconds with Retention Perk, and +10 skill points with Comprehension Perk) and each now weighs 1 pound.
    Decreased spawned loot, with the amount of loot now based on your Permanent Luck stat.
    Dynamic Respawn Rate: is set at the beginning of the game at a random amount (every 4 to 8 days; default was 3 days), and is reset whenever you level up.
    Reduced Carrying Capacity (gender based): female range is from 60 to 150 pounds (for 1 to 10 STR); male range is 65 to 200 pounds.
    Bartering Overhaul: Merchants will charge a LOT more for items, and you&apos;ll get a LOT less for what you trade with them (based on your Bartering skill). Gender based: females have 10% Barter sell bonus; males have a 5% buy bonus.
    Repair Overhaul: items used for repairs will now improve the weapon or armor a bit less, your repair limit is now gender-based (male bonus). Merchant repair costs were significantly reduced, and are based on your Barter skill. This should make paying for repairs a more viable option.
    With my default Hard-Core settings you receive Gender bonuses/penalties (affects Health Points, Carrying Capacity, Bartering, and Self-Repairs). This was done so that gameplay would be a bit different, depending on your character&apos;s gender. The gender differences are minor, and can be mostly overcome, just by adjusting your point distribution. (For example: A female with 5END &amp; 6STR would have nearly the same Carrying Capacity and Health Points, as a male with 6END &amp; 5STR.)
    You can select a More or Less Difficult Hard-Core setting in the Options Menu (under Other Settings), which can be changed at any time. More Difficult is enabled by default, and is my recommended setting. The Less Difficult setting gives the player more HPs, greater Carrying Capacity, easier Bartering and Repair, removes gender differences from stats, and reduces health damage with Med-Tec injuries.
MED-TEC MODULE (Arwen_Med-Tec.esp):
    This optional module is a complete Needs/Injuries Mod.(Requires my Core Master esm and Realism Core module).
    Works best when default hardcore mode is NOT enabled. [It will work with default hardcore mode, but with more message spamming, which will be confusing at times].
    IMPORTANT! This is my most complex module, so you really should read my &quot;Realism Tweaks User Guide.doc&quot; (in Fallout New Vegas\Data) and/or the Fallout New Vegas Realism Tweaks section of my website , which explains all the details.
    Warning! This module takes survival to a whole new level. Even when you survive combat, you can now easily die from your injuries (just like in real life). Also taking care of your Needs (thirst, hunger, sleep) is no longer as easy, since mine are based on realistic rates; and the penalties for neglecting your Needs are much more severe.
    My Med-Tec Quest begins about 30 seconds after the Encumbrance Quest has completed; or after being initialized in a saved game. The quest’s timer is paused when you are inside or engaged in combat.
    After the Med-Tec Scanner is fully initialized, you receive 1 Medical Brace, 2 Bandages, 1 Antibiotic Injection, 1 Stimpak, and a Bottle of Purified Water.
    Your current Needs will be based on how much game time has passed since 6 am. Your current Wound Level and Blood Lost will be based on how much your HP is damaged.
    Your Med-Tec Scanner tracks 26 stats and expands self-treatment. Quick Scan Hotkey [M] monitors your most vital stats during game play, with automatic scan whenever you are injured. Full Scan Hotkey [Right Ctrl] for diagnosis and treatment of injuries and additional Needs info.
    No Fast Travel when very tired, thirsty, or hungry, or Health is less than 40%.
    The Injury Part:
    Injuries are based directly on degree of injury, type of weapon used, and your Armor Level. Adds Wounds, Burns, Blood Loss, Trauma, and Infections (and their treatment). When my default &quot;More Difficult Hard-Core&quot; is enabled, a fixed percentage of your remaining HPs are also damaged with every bullet hit, cutting and trauma injury (this scripted HP damage is in addition to the regular weapon DAM).
    Moderate injuries slowly heal, based on your Endurance. Severe injuries require medical treatment, where self-treatments are based on your Medicine skill.
    Dynamic Health Regeneration: Your regen rate restores your Permanent HP amount every 10 game hours, but is slower when sleeping or waiting (prevents sleep/wait healing cheat).
    Your Health stops Regenerating when your Wound Level is 2 or greater, or when you are Very Thirsty, or Famished, or Exhausted.
    Wounds increase in severity up to Level 10; Moderate Wounds begin at Level 2 (when your health regen stops); Severe Wounds begin at Level 5 (where you suffer from loss of blood). Wounds higher than Level 4 will slowly become infected. Once an infection reaches Level 6, it damages your health and the only treatment is an injection of Antibiotics.
    Bleeding is treated by applying bandages or by injecting Stimpaks (which speed up clotting). A leather belt can be used to temporarily reduce blood flow. Bleeding stops once your Wound Level drops below 5.
    Bandages can be applied during combat (from inventory or if added to a hotkey slot); but only for bleeding wounds (not for burns, which can still only be treated during the Full Scan). Bandage application is animated, which disables player movement for several seconds.
    Blood Level is tracked in units of Blood Lost: if your Blood Lost reaches 8, your health will deteriorate. Blood slowly regenerates on its own, but you may need a Blood Transfusion to recover after excessive blood loss.
    Burns increase in severity up to Level 12, with Severe Burns beginning at Level 8 (Third-Degree Burns).
    Trauma injuries (bruising and tissue damage) increase in severity up to Level 10, with Severe Trauma beginning at Level 7 (Torso Trauma)
    Damaged limbs slowly heal, but only if the limb is not crippled (a Medical Brace is then require to heal). Braces can be used multiple times if your medical skills are high enough.
    Doctor&apos;s Bags require 25 Medicine, only non-crippled limbs are treated, and Head and Torso injuries will be healed 20% (even if crippled). The Doctor&apos;s Bag is no longer consumed, but is replaced with an Empty Doctor&apos;s Bag (used to craft a new Doctor Bag).
    Doctors no longer fully heal moderate or severe injuries. What you get for your caps is treatment, not instant health restoration (you will often leave splinted and bandaged).
    Bandages, Tourniquets, and Splints all have penalties while they are equipped, and are automatically removed when they are no longer needed.
    Stimpak Animation Effect (with Hotkey): You can still give yourself an injection during combat, but this now happens in real time, while you will be incapacitated for a few seconds. Each injection also damages your Fatigue, messes up your vision, and reduces your Strength. Stimpaks will not restore your Health higher than 75% (this is balanced by my Health Regen).
    Morphine and Antibiotic injections also use the injection animation (but no hotkeys). Morphine injections also include a visual penalty and damage Intelligence.
    Most other chems were also rebalanced, and Med-Tec supplies for doctors and some general merchants are restocked daily (time varies, based on your Luck stat).
    The Needs Part:
    Note: If you have the default hardcore mode enabled, the default needs will be deactivated, but the default display will still function and will be kept in sync with my Med-Tec Needs. The default Needs messages will still appear, but are now based on my Med-Tec Needs.
    Water Need is now Dynamic: basic requirement is 48 ounces/day, but increases 50% while outdoors in the heat of the day, and drops 25% when your encumbrance is less than 70%. Your Water Need decreases 50% while sleeping.
    Most Beverages and fruit give you some water benefit, with the greatest amounts coming from the purest types of bottled water.
    With the exception of Purified Bottled Water, beverages no longer have any Healing effect, contain Rads, and will damage your health a bit.
    Purified Bottled Water restores some Health, but only when you have less than 70 HP, and only if your Water Need is greater than 0.
    Any water bottle can be refilled at both Purified and Good water sources. A Pure or Good water bottle both yields a bottle of Good water, at either source. A Dirty water bottle always yields a bottle of Dirty water.
    Liquor now dehydrates you, but also restores your Fatigue.
    Nuka Colas (and other stimulants) use my Jolt effect to reduce your Sleep Need, but your Need jumps back up when my Jolt effect wears off.
    Food Need is also Dynamic: your personal Food Need is now based on your Permanent Strength and Endurance. An average PC requires 24 Food Units every 24 game hours (1 unit/hour). There are 10 Food Levels, from Food+1 through Food+10. Uncooked food is now higher in Rads, but Fresh Fruit and Vegetables will now reduce your Rads. Food no longer has any healing effect.
    Cooking is more necessary: meat taken from dead animals is now Raw Meat (high in bacteria and RADS). Raw Meat and some of the packaged food will be less nourishing unless it is cooked. Includes new recipes for all this raw meat and for the packaged food.
    You can only butcher an animal (access their inventory) if you equip one of the following specific knives: Knife, Combat Knife, or Chance&apos;s Knife (unique Combat Knife).
    Dead animals will now only have usable meat for 6 game hours after they are killed (does not affect ones that were dead before you entered that cell).
    Raw Meat Limit: You can only remove meat from animals if you have less than 4 chunks of raw meat in your inventory; plus you only have room to carry 4 chunks of raw meat (you will drop any additional raw meat).
    A Cooking Kit is required for most of the campfire recipes; and a Mess Kit makes eating meals much more sanitary (lower in bacteria). Both Kits can be purchased from most merchants, or crafted if you have the skill.
    Bandages can be crafted at Campfires: requires Cook Kit, Abraxo Cleaner, and CLEAN Pre-War clothing or Settler Outfit (like the oneDoc gave you).
    New basic &quot;Pan Fried&quot; recipes do not require the full Cook Kit; but you must have both a Metal Cooking Pan and a large, sharp knife in your inventory for these new recipes to be visible.
    Eating causes your Digestion Level to increase (will slowly decrease when you are not eating). Your Digestion Level is displayed whenever it increases, and when it decreases by 1 Level point (it can also be checked when you do a Full Med-Tec scan, under &quot;Food, Water, Sleep Needs&quot;).
    Eating when you are not hungry makes you sick, gaining no benefit from the food. But your Digestion Level will still increase a bit (because you now have indigestion).
    When your RADS are 100 or higher, your Radiation Level will increase while you are digesting food; and will slowly decrease once your Digestive Level returns to 0, or whenever your RADS drop below 100. You get Radiation Sickness when your Radiation Level reaches 5, and you no longer gain any benefit from eating or drinking (you will just get sick). Radiation Sickness lasts until your Radiation Level drops back down below 5.
    Bacteria Level: Uncooked meat and open sources of water (cisterns, puddles, streams, etc.) are high in Bacteria. The only water that is free of Bacteria is purified bottled water. Having a Mess Kit in your inventory when you eat most food will reduce the amount of Bacteria. If your Bacteria Level reaches 5, you will become sick with food poisoning. There is no treatment for Food Poisoning, you just have to wait until your bacteria level drops below Level 5. You will gain no benefit from eating when you have Food Poisoning, you will just get sick.
    Needs Menu (in Med-Tec Full Scan menu): Similar to my Bottle Water menu, where your Bacteria, Digestion, and Radiation Levels are shown (along with 6 other stats). This will lessen the chances of getting Food Poisoning, by showing your Bacteria Level before you drink. You can drink any of your bottled water, from within the Needs Menu (or by selecting in your PipBoy). I added drinking animations to bottle water, which are similar to my Stimpak animations. The Needs menu also gives the maximum Food Units you can safely eat (based on your current Bacteria, Radiation, and Digestion Levels).
    You require 1 hour of Sleep for every 2 hours that you are awake. When your Sleep Need is 0, you won&apos;t need to sleep for 16 hours before becoming Sleepy; after 20 hours you&apos;ll be Very Tired; after 24 hours you&apos;ll be Exhausted. You heal while you are sleeping, but at a slower rate than when you are awake, and with the same restrictions (both are also true for Waiting). [This removes the sleep/wait cheat, where sleeping/waiting for a few hours could completely heal most of your injuries.] You cannot sleep when you have excessive bleeding; you cannot take a nap until your Sleep Need is greater than 1 hour; and the longest you can sleep is the amount of your Sleep Need (rounded up).
    Tanning Hides now requires that you have a large, sharp knife (a combat-type knife) in your inventory for the tanning recipes to be visible.
    [Med-Tec Options menu]: Prepare to uninstall; Change the Med-Tec Scan hotkey; change the Stimpak Injection hotkey.
One Life module (Arwen_NV_OneLife.esp):
    This optional module was balanced to be used with my Full Realism Tweaks. (Requires my Core Master esm and Realism Core module.) It does not require my Med-Tec module, but was coded to work with my Med-Tec Injuries and Needs.
    Important! Auto-Saves MUST be disabled when this module is active, and please do not use Quick-Saves or Quick-Loads (or any mod that alters the default saves or adds automatic saves). This module relies on my scripted saves, and if the most recent save is not a One Life save, the module will not function correctly.
    You no longer die. Instead you now pass out and are left for dead. When you finally do come to again, you discover that you have been looted. This is my own unique concept, where your character&apos;s death becomes a major penalty, instead of just an inconvenient reload.
    There are now two different ways that will result in your &quot;death&quot;:
    1.) Normal Death happens when your HPs are reduced to zero faster than my Near Death can save you. Loads your last OneLife_Death save, along with my added penalties for &quot;dying.&quot;
    2.) Near Death kicks in just before your HPs bottom out. You immediately pass out and are revived, usually without an automatic reload (the penalties are mostly identical to Normal Death).
    Your character is generally revived at your last set Revival Point and your Stats are saved in special One Life scripted saves (these are updated shortly after loading a saved game).
    When you come to, you discover that you were unconscious for hours. A percentage of your caps, Stimpaks, and equipped weapon&apos;s ammo is looted. Your equipped weapon is damaged (when your Luck was really low, your weapon is looted). With Near Death, your equipped body armor is damage a bit and removed to your inventory; with Normal Death, your equipped body armor is looted (if its Armor Level &gt; 2).
    If my Med-Tec module is installed, your stimpaks will not be looted. But your injuries and Needs will increase when you &quot;die,&quot; based on how long you were unconscious.
    Rescue feature: only kicks in if my Med-Tec module is also active when you trigger a One Life death (works with both Normal Death and Near Death), AND only when your injury levels are high, AND when you have no stimpaks or bandages left. You will then revive at a safer location, where your injuries have been treated (but you may still be in pretty rough shape; and &quot;safer&quot; is a relative term). This was done to prevent a death/revival/death endless loop, since you should now be able to recover (as long as you avoid combat while your injuries heal).
    One Life saves are timed to update about every 6 real minutes (if you are not in combat and your health is greater than 15%), or when you move between interior and exterior cells. Changing armor or equipping a different weapon will trigger a One Life save sooner.
    One Life saves are done as pairs: the OneLife_Death save automatically revives your character after they die (Normal Death); Loading a OneLife_Alive save will restore your game at the last OneLife autosave(without penalties).
    There are 3 rotating OneLife_Alive saves (older saves are overwritten by newer ones), so you may want to do an occasional manual save. But if you die before my scripted save is updated, the default death/reload will be triggered. [Hint: after you make a manual save, equip a different weapon and the next One Life save will happen sooner.]
    Do NOT load the OneLife_Death save, as doing so will initiate a death-reload (as if your character died), with all the penalties of &quot;dying.&quot; [If, however, the game crashed after your character &quot;died,&quot; or during the One Life restoration sequence, loading the most recent OneLife_Death save will generally restore your &quot;dead&quot; character correctly.]
    When you are finished with a game session, you should always make a manual save before you quite the game.
    New &quot;Lite&quot; version (can be selected during install): use the Arwen_NV_OneLife_Lite.esp if my regular One Life module seems to increase your CTDs. Has nearly the same Normal Death and Near Death penalties as the regular version; the main difference is the way Near Death revives the player. In the Lite version you are not moved from where you died, but are revived right where you died. Unfortunately this means that your enemies may still be waiting for you, which will often result in you dying again (probably a Normal Death this time). Also your Normal Death revival locations are MUCH less random than with my regular version. Note: Only have one of the One Life esps active at a time.
Camera module (Arwen_Camera.esp):
    Optional, totally independent module.
    I really didn&apos;t like the default over-the-shoulder camera, because of how far off center it was.
    My version is MUCH tighter (closer to center), resulting in a true over-the-shoulder view, making it easier to aim when in 3rd person.
    The Kill Camera mode (if you have this enabled) happens less often and is now a second shorter in length, making it much less distracting during combat.
    The Chase Camera&apos;s maximum distance is 3 times further away, so that you can now view you entire character. Plus you can now zoom out 3 times further when you&apos;re in vanity mode.
Read my ReadMe for:
    Installing/uninstalling (and Updating) procedures (which MUST be followed, or you run the risk of messing up your character&apos;s stats, and your Fatigue and Strain HUDs will not be displayed).
    Load Order.
    Compatibility/Incompatibility with other mods (includes special instructions on using with other mods, like Project Nevada).

Name: Art of Seduction
Version: 3.6.9 WIP 
Author: tiger8u2
Date: 060112
REQUIREMENT - FNV SI.  Please don\&apos;t ask for a version without it.
Non-Vanilla NPC\&apos;s - The Initial Orientation of mod added NPC\&apos;s will be established randomly when you speak to them using AOS dialogue.  IF you want them to have a specific orientation you will need to find out what the mod index of AOS is, find out what the faction base ID is and then open the console, click on the NPC and type SETFACTIONRANK XXXXXXXX 0 &lt;enter&gt;.  (The orientation faction base ID\&apos;s are listed below.)
* SPECIAL ADDITION - If you would like your wedding information RECORDED in game please send me an IM or make a post with the IN-GAME information and I will put it in a special book at the Chapel of Love.  If someone could show me how to update messages dynamically in-game then I could do it that way.  As it stands I have an activator shaped like a book that displays a certain number of messages that are pre-created.  With information provided by players I will update these pre-created messages and ADD them to the game.  I can create any number of Record books for this.  Please include the players name, who they wed, when (day, date), preacher\&apos;s name and where.
Description
==============================================
Warning:  This is an ADULT mod, designed for ADULTS with ADULT themes and no on under the age of 18 should be permitted to download or use it.  This mod is for ROLEPLAYERS to allow them to enjoy dialogue that explores and enhances the \&quot;relationship\&quot; with an NPC. 
Till now, mods based upon the FNV Sexual Innuendo wsexQuest and even Animated Prostitution have not taken the sexual orientation of an NPC or the player into consideration when determining sexual opportunity.  
You can basically go around the Mojave and bang anyone, no matter what sex your Player Character is or what the demonstrated sexual orientation of the NPC is. (i.e.  Craig Boone is Straight, Arcade Gannon is Gay, Veronica is Lesbian, Rose of Sharon Cassidy is probably Bisexual, etc., etc., etc.)  
They also don\&apos;t take into consideration the \&quot;MODESTY\&apos; of the NPC.  An NPC with LOW aggression and LOW confidence is probably NOT going to just drop their pants in public.  
THIS mod aims to give roleplaying players the chance to SEDUCE NPC\&apos;s over time while they communicate with the NPC\&apos;s about feelings, give gifts, give aid, recieve gifts, recieve aid, and complete quests.
It also takes into consideration an NPC\&apos;s aggression &amp; confidence when determining whether they will have sex with the Player when asked OR whether they will DEMAND to be married first or at least go someplace more private.
As you can imagine, an NPC with LOW aggression and LOW confidence would probably WANT the assurance of an engagement ring or marriage license before sharing their most PRIVATE and PERSONAL favors.
Here is what I\&apos;ve been working on and what is Complete or a Work in Progress:
(Complete) Implements dialogue whereby the player \&quot;seduces\&quot; NPC\&apos;s based upon disposition and Player/NPC sexual orientation.  IF someone LOVES you....you can try to \&quot;Take it 2 the Next Level.\&quot;  Your success will be determined by the PC\&apos;s sexual orientation and the NPC\&apos;s sexual orientation tied to their aggression and confidence levels.
The sexual orientations implemented in this mod are:
ASexual - (XX0049BB) - Abstinent - will initially have sex with NOBODY. IF you choose to be abstinent at first...and have sex - your sexual orientation WILL change.
Bisexual - (XX0049B9) - Will have sex with males or females and thier orientation seldom changes.
Gay/Lesbian - (XX0049BA) - Gay Males won\&apos;t have sex with females &amp; Gay Females/Lesbians won\&apos;t have sex with Males.  IF a Gay male has sex with a female their sexual orientation WILL change to Bisexual.  IF a Gay Female/Lesbian has sex with a male their sexual orientation WILL change to Bisexual.
Straight - (XX0049B8) - Straight Males won\&apos;t have sex with Asexual, Bisexual, Gay or Straight Males.  IF they do their sexual orientation WILL change to Bisexual.  Straight Females won\&apos;t have sex with ASexual, Bisexual, Gay or Straight Females.  IF they do, their sexual orientation WILL change to Bisexual.
Besides a number of NPC\&apos;s I\&apos;ve PREDefined to make this more believable - the sexual orientation of NPC\&apos;s is RANDOMLY determined during dialogue.
FYI - The scripting DOES take the prostitute class into consideration and will assign the bisexual faction to NPC\&apos;s of that class.
Unfortunately, in order to implement this efficiently, using \&quot;setfactionrank\&quot; during dialogue I am adding factions to the BASE record of an NPC.  SO....IF the BASE record of an NPC is part of a leveled list then every instance of that BASE record will be affected after initial contact with ONE of the spawns from the Base Object.
I don\&apos;t recommend chatting up the wandering NPC\&apos;s on the strip.  They get destroyed and respawned any time they pass through the gates or enter one of the clubs.
IF you have a suggestion as to implementing the initial proper sexual orientation for an NPC please let me know.
(Complete) Implements dialogue whereby the player can take NPC\&apos;s to Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner &amp; have a Romantic Picnic in the wilds.
(Complete) Implements dialogue whereby the player can MARRY any number of NPC\&apos;s.
(Complete) Implements dialogue whereby the player can have any number of lovers if not married.
(Work in Progress)  Implements dialogue whereby the player must get a \&quot;Kitchen Pass\&quot; before they can try to make love to anyone but their husband/husbands or wife/wives once married if not already a lover.
(Partially Implemented) Changes to Player &amp; NPC sexual orientation based upon sexual activity.
(Work in Progress) Implements dialogue whereby the player can overcome \&quot;holdouts\&quot; who refuse to have sexual relations initially.
(Work in Progress)  Scripting changes to Player/NPC sexual orientation based upon wsexQuest results (Bad/OK/Good/Great).
Requirements
==============================================
FNV Sexual Innuendo w/Hotfix H007-2
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36659
Smalltalk by Kaeser
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41815
KNOWN BUGS
==============================================
Make sure you are on a reasonably level area before trying to have a picnic.  If not, the handy seating arrangement might get placed into the game geometry and become unusable.
During breakfast/lunch/dinner or picnic the PC refuses to stay sitting during dialogue.  I\&apos;ve tried restraining the PC but I haven\&apos;t figured out yet how to keep the PC sitting yet.  If anyone has a fix for that I\&apos;d love to hear it.
Don\&apos;t drop engagement/wedding rings.  They don\&apos;t have a ground model. (Actually they are quest items - which is NOT going to work.  Fixing that now.
TIP - If you get denied and the NPC won\&apos;t speak to you anymore because they are FLEE mode, just go talk to anyone else and ask if they are hungry.  This will reset the variables controlling the FLEE package.  Leaving the cell the NPC is in and returning also resets their AI.
If the wsexQuest sextype is 4 - it messes with the animations start.  Working to fix it now.
NPC\&apos;s can have their weapons sticking out of their bodies during animations.  Put them in Sandbox mode beforehand or take their weapons away for a bit before letting them sex themselves up.
Recommend you take the NPC\&apos;s you want to watch have sex to a secluded spot.  In other words, there should only be the three of you either in an interior or somewhere away from other NPC\&apos;s.  If not, the NPC you found the fun for may just walk up to someone else and the script will get messy.
Not ALL Securitrons will have the Marriage License/Wedding Dialogue.  The ones outside The Strip don\&apos;t seem to belong to the same \&quot;dialogue\&quot; faction as the ones inside.  IF you get no joy from a Securitron try another till you find the one that has the dialogue.  Surprisingly enough, the ones nearby the NCR Ambassador DO have the dialogue so go figure.
CHANGELOG
==============================================
3.6.9 - Added player marriage information to book at the Chapel of Love per request.
3.6.8 - Removed some test AI packages from the Weatherly family.
3.6.7 - Drowchyld777 suggested adding alcohol &amp; chems as gifts to NPC\&apos;s.  Added dialogue to implement part of that suggestion at this time.
3.6.6 - Added a missing Securitron dialogue faction to the marriage quest.  Tried to eliminate all unnecessary dialogue from showing up on creatures.  
3.6.5 - Fixed Securitron Marriage dialogue hopefully
3.6.4 - Fixed some sex scripts that could cause bad animations.
3.6.3 - Kreutz had ideas about making marrying certain NPC\&apos;s a bit harder.  I implemented his ideas on Veronica as a test.  Somebody please run out and try to marry her.
3.6.2 - \&quot;Can we cut to the chase\&quot; dialogue fixed.  Fiends Marriage Quest is finished.
3.6.1 - Kainschilde209 had some ideas and I ran with them.
3.6 - Fixed some gift giving conditions to prevent giving a legion ear to an NPC when the player didn\&apos;t have one. Thanks Ozlander!
3.5 - Fixed a marriage variable to apply to all marriages which made the wedding ring script WORK no matter which faction it was used for.  Edited Joanna\&apos;s Dialogue to allow topics to show.  
3.4 - Added Boomer Marriage Quest.  Removed Fiends from normal marriage quest.
3.3 - BOS &amp; Legion Marriage quests got broke when I \&quot;FIXED\&quot; the engagement ring.  I had to fix that and rework the BOS Marriage dialogue.  Apprentice Watkins and I successfully tied the know so I know it works now.  Also added a fallback BOS NPC and dialogue in case the player decides to blow up the bunker....although NOT many BOS peeps will like you much after that.
3.2 - Added Prostitute Dialogue Quest.  Added a \&quot;working\&quot; prostitute in Gomorrah.  Several dialogue fixes to hopefully make Faction Marriage quests work better.  Added dialogue for Veronica to reflect marriage status with a male player.
3.1 - Fixed more Marriage Quest issues.  Added some Male &amp; Female slaves to the Fort.
3.0 - Updated Swinging dialogue to allow choices of sex acts.
2.9 - Fixed Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner Dialogues.  Thanks Scorpial!
2.8 - Fixed Love Potion dialogue that was not showing up properly.
2.7 - Fixed Marriage Quest dialogue again where dialogue for wasteland preachers would not show up.  Need Joshua Branch Tested more.   He works in my game.  Please let me know.
2.6 - Fixed Marriage Quest dialogue condition which was preventing proposal dialogue from showing up if NOT a fiance.  Fixed engagement ring to HOPEFULLY not place player into the Fiance faction until the right time.  (Needs tested.) EDIT - Fixed even more dialogue that depended upon a variable I changed usage of.
2.5 - Fixed Marriage Quest dialogue to show properly and prevent player from buying high priced rings with less caps in their inventory than needed.  Added a Marriage Record book to allow players to have their wedding recorded. (Have to IM me the info unfortunately, unless someone can show me how to update a MESSAGE file dynamically.)  Added player stat enhancements from reading \&quot;The Book\&quot; passages.
2.4 - Added a BOS Marriage Quest.  Added a Chapel of Love. Added Art of Seducton dialogue topics to The Rose of Sharon Cassidy Followers Quest.
2.3 - Fixed wedding dialogue so Legion topics don\&apos;t show.  Fixed watching NPC have sex/swinging package.  Added the Kings Faction to the Wedding Quest dialogue so that now ANY King in Freeside can sell rings and perform the marriage ceremony.
2.2 - Added missing variable assignment that prevented Take-it-2-Next level dialogue from showing if the NPC had already agreed to sex but wanted to go somewhere private.  Added the Gommorah Suites as a suitable private location to take an NPC.  Reworked the \&quot;Have Sex With Someone\&quot; while I watch package.  Still can glitch for some reason.
2.1 - Fixed the last part of the Legion Marriage Ceremony so that the KISS happens and the quest resets as required.
2.0 - Fixed some stupid errors that kept the Legion Marriage quest from showing up.  Fixed misc item that was missing a script.  Tried to fix HtM slave dialogue from not showing up but I did more harm than good so I had to scrap that.
1.9 - Scorpial gave me input that made me decide to create a separate Legion Marriage quest.  This will make it possible for players who side with the Legion to get married.  The quest will work whether Caesar is alive or dead and is the ONLY way to marry legion slaves.
1.8 - Fixed Post Marriage Dialogue where Hold-outs would show up.  Fixed Alice Mclafferty\&apos;s Hold-out dialogue.
1.7 - Created a new faction and a way for Husbands/Wives to ask their Husband/Wife for a Swinger\&apos;s Pass.  It\&apos;s for when you ask someone who is NOT a Lover, or Fiance, or Spouse, about wanting to watch them have sex, then IF they like you enough, you can TAG them as a Swinging partner.  That means you can watch any two NPC\&apos;s you choose having sex.  The ability to watch Lover\&apos;s, Fiance\&apos;s &amp; Spouses having sex with each other has not changed.
1.6 - Moved \&quot;Kitchen Pass\&quot; removal to sex results stage and limited it to NPC\&apos;s other than a Spouse or Fiance.  Put some \&quot;removescriptpackage\&quot; in sex results to prevent FOLLOWERS from just standing around.  Put some resets in where they would work.  Changed Engagement dialogue to include a possibility your Fiance breaks off the engagement if you hound her for sex.
1.5 - Fixed \&quot;Cut to the Chase\&quot; dialogue to ensure no access to dialogue until NPC Orientation has been assigned.
1.4 - Fixed linking mistake that was keeping some POST wedding dialogue from displaying.  Added a TOPIC that \&quot;Cuts to the Chase\&quot; so to speak.  
1.3 - Fixed POST wedding dialogue.  Added dialogue whereby you can PICK a lover/wife/husband to have sex with another lover or wife/husband while you watch.
1.2 - Fixed wedding dialogue - I married Veronica so I know it works.  One way to get rid of that nasty HOLDOUT faction.  Worked on POST marriage lovers dialogue.  Still not right.
1.1 - Fixed dialogue related to selling engagement rings/wedding rings.  Merchant container scrapped in favor of dialogue.
1.0 - Added dialogue to FIX certain times when wsexQuest tokens get left behind on the player or NPC.  This will help with the Katie follower NPC who often gets stuck masturbating herself.
.9 - Fixed some dialogue scripts that would make Lesbians straight inadvertently.  Realigned the Gay Male overture to Straight Females which would CHANGE the Player\&apos;s orientation to Bisexual.
.8 - Broke Hold-out dialogue with last update.  Fixed it.
.7 - Consolidated dialogue to prevent options appearing for NPC\&apos;S who were NOT faction flagged.  Recommend CLEAN install to remove topics.
.6 - Fixed dialogue to allow player to UPDATE NPC sexual orientation OR Revert it back to before mod was activated.
.5 - Fixed spelling error - added confidence effects to meals and boosted their effects.
.4 - Changed quest item status on items that should not have been.  Added a free-form Love Potion quest.
.3 - Added scripting to ensure all OldAged race NPCs are initially set to Abstinent.  
.2 - Hopefully fixed a GETRANDOMPERCENT scripting error.

The KatieNPC_eng.esp is the English version! The KatieNPC_ger.esp is the German version!
ALLWAYS use only one of them. NEVER use both!!!
PLEASE REPORT BUGS!!! Please give me a feedback.
Katie is a full working NPC with compainon wheel. She&apos;s alone in the wasteland and it&apos;s your turn, to take care of her! If you run the quest, you can&apos;t miss her. You&apos;ll find Katie in the Prospector Saloon.
If you make her drunk oder you giver her drugs or presents, she&apos;ll fall in love with you. Find out, what she likes to drink or which drugs she needs.
The more Katie likes you, the more you get from her! :)
At least you&apos;ll find out, that you get everything you want!
This mod only works with male characters! (sorry Girlz!).</thetext>

 Fallout 3 Version Here!
Now with Hardcore Mode see change log below for details.
Useable Toilets, Urinals, and Bathtubs - with sound fx
V.5
This archive contains 2 esp files
UseableToilets.esp
UseableToiletsUninstall.esp
Only use the first one if you are installing the mod, the second esp is for uninstalling and replacing toilets disabled by the first.
This mod requires the latest version of NVSE
You can download NVSE here http://nvse.silverlock.org/
----------
Important
----------
Please reset hardcore mode using the Toilet Paper item by turning it off, then back on. This will help prevent problems as some of the timers used in the mod have changed.
------------
Description New Hardcore mode added, see change log below for details!
------------
This mod adds an inventory item called Toilet Paper to the aid section of the pip boy. When you enter a new cell, or find a fixture that you want to replace click the Toilet Paper and select the desired option. If you are replacing toilets in your own home, or somewhere you wouldn&apos;t expect to find random NPCs using the toilets, select the add toilets to my home option.
Sit on toilets will play a flushing sound when you or an NPC get up from them and walk away.
Urinals will play an unzip sound, peeing sound, and zip sound when used. To use a urinal simply walk up to it very close. Urinals are only for male characters, sorry ladies.
Tubs can sit two people. They will unequip your clothing, if you are wearing any, and play enter and leave splashing sounds. Upon leaving your clothing will be re-equipped. Placeable tubs will only do the above for the player due to some placement limitations. Replaced tube will do the above for the player and one companion, if two companions are in the tub only the first one entering will be affected.
If you decide you don&apos;t want the placeable tub anymore open console, click it to show its id at the top of the screen and type, disable followed by the enter key, then MarkForDelete followed by the enter key. Repeat the process for the water mesh.
Companions with a sit option can use toilets.
------
Notes
-----
Why create this mod when at least one other mod with sit on toilets exists? When I came across these meshes I thought it was a good idea. Who wants to drink from a dirty toilet anyway? The mods I saw were replacer mods where the mod authors went in and hand replaced the old toilets with the sit on type. That can cause conflicts with other mods that change cells obviously, plus it doesn&apos;t affect newly created cells from other mods.
After the initial release for FO3 I included usable urinals, and bathtubs. Even added placeable bathtubs that you can purchase from the merchant in the GoodSprings General Store. The items are called Dirty Tub, Clean Tub, and Cleanest Tub, and sell for 300, 600, and 1000 caps respectively. Tubs weigh 50lbs to add some realism (yes I know a cast iron tub like this would actually be a few hundred pounds).
To place a purchased tub Drop the item from the misc scetion of your inventory. The tub can then be placed using the z key. Once in position enter sneak mode and activate the tub to set yout new useable two person tub.
Tubs, the placeable kind and the replacements for existing tubs are scaled up a bit (to avoid some clipping, feet still stick through the bottom, sorry best I can do) so keep this in mind when placing them.
My approach, while a little more combersome, allows for greater compatability along with support for other mods.
--------
Warning
--------
This mod will disable existing toilets and tubs and replace them with the useable variety. Uninstalling this mod will leave you with an empty spot where they used to be. Be sure to activate the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp to replace those toilets, and leave it installed until you are sure all have been re-enabled.
-----------
Change Log
-----------
8-26-12: Changed the timers concerning the pee time variable. The new timer gives 12 hpurs before any warnings, then an additional warning each 3 hours. At the 21 hour mark an accident will happen if you do not find a toilet or use the No Pee chem. Be sure to reset hardcore mode using the Toilet Paper item to ensure the new timers are activated properly.
Added out houses as useable toilets. They function just like other toilets from this mod, but do not use the flushing sound. These out houses just have a script attached to the base object, so no need to run the Toilet Paper replacer function, they should work when activated.
Also added the Ultra Lux toilets to the replacer script, as it was pointed out I missed them in previous versions.
Lastly I added the ability to bathe in bodies of water, providing you have some Abraxo cleaner. To bathe in water bring up the pipboy and find the Toilet Paper aid item. Hole the zoom button (which should inform you that you can not drop quest items) And left click the Toilet Paper while still holding zoom. If you are in the water your armor should be removed, and the script will run just like in a bath tub cleaning the dirt over time. Only natural water bodies will work, not placeable water.
Previous update: Two new items are added to the camp fire menu
No-Pee
No-Poo
Each of these items will extend the time until your next bathroom visit. When using them your timer will be reset, but agailty penalty will remain until you find and use a toilet. Currently each recipe requires a dirty water, and either Broc Flower (for pee) or xander root (for poo).
5-22-12: Added an option to bind a hot key (of your selection) to display your current bathroom timers and mod penalties. Only available in hardcore mode obviously. If you elect not to bind a key, or later wish to change the key you selected, just restart hardcore mode.
5-14-12: Small change to the toilet script to prevent ladies from getting stuck while going No1. Previously pressing a directional control caused the script to halt leaving the player in a restrained state. Changed it to disable player controls while the sound is playing to avoid the issue. You will still not be able to get up until the sound stops, or a couple seconds after.
5-10-12: Fixed a couple script errors I found. Namely the dirt variable tracking, and the start/stop hardcore option. Should both work right now. Also found an interesting bug where the cha variable gats stored as -0.00, you can see this in the show stats option after you have restored charisma previously damaged from dirt. The game throws out this negative zero, then doesn&apos;t know quite how to deal with it. I was able to get around the issue, but I find it interesting so I thought would mention it.
5-9-12: Two new items, Fancy Shampoo, and Bath Beads. Both are sold by Old Lady Gibson, and the Street Vendor on the the Vegas Strip. When sold out they will restock in 7 game days. Having these items in your inventory while bathing will grant the Fresh Scent bouns, which boosts Charisma by 1 for 6 or 12 hours depending on if you have one or both items.
Fixed a bug where toilet sounds still played when pressing fire button even after getting up from the toilet.
Added splash sound when pressing the fire button while in tubs.
5-06-12: New Hardcore mode added.Not dependent on Hardcore mode selection in the game. Default is turned on, but you can turn it off in the toilet paper options menu if you prefer.
Players will have to use toilets, and tubs based on a time scale.
Peeing will need to be done once every 9 hours to avoid having an accident. At the 6 hour mark a message will be displayed &quot;you need to pee 1&quot;, and your agility will be decreased by 1. At 7 hours a message saying &quot;you need to pee 2&quot;, accompanied by another loss of 1 agility. * hour mark &quot;you need to pee 3&quot; agility -1. This is a total agility loss of 3 at this point. At the 9 hour mark a message saying &quot;you wet yourself&quot; will be displayed. At that point agility will return to normal, and your charisma will drop by .2 Peeing anytime before you wet yourself will reset agility, if any is lost, and reset the timer
Potty will have to be done once every 33 hours to avoid having an accident. Potty is treated the same as pee accept the times are 24, 27, 30, and 33. Each is accompanied by the -1 agility with the 33 mark restoring agility and decreasing charisma by 1.
Bathing will need to be done once a day to avoid a loss in character Charisma.It is handled on the same time scale as potty where 24 hours you get your first message that you need to bathe. Then every 3 hours you will get the message again. The first message results in a chariama drop of 1, and each following message at the 3 hour intervals results in an additional .2 loss to charisma.
The dirt variable is used to track your total charisma loss due to having accidents, and not bathing. every point of dirt is equal to -.2 charisma.
Bathing is the only way to remove dirt and restore your charisma. While bathing you will restore .2 charisma every second you are in the tub. When dirt has been completely removed you will get a message box saying you are clean.
There are two items you will need to have in your inventory to use the toilets and tubs efficently. One is lottery tickets (for toilet paper) the other is abraxo cleaner (for tub bathing). Both of these items have been added to varions merchants throughout New Vegas and they will restock a few seconds after they run out. A full box of cleaner will remove about 60 dirt, and one lotto ticket will be used when using the toilets. Male characters only consume TP when going potty.
The menu has changed to add a few new options, and consolidate the old options. New is show status which will display the time you have to pee, potty, and bathe. It also displays your total dirt, charisma and agility penalties. There is also an option to turn off/restart the needs part of the mod. When turning off the feature your agility and charisma should be restored if they were lowered.
Sleeping will suspend your timers, so you shouldn&apos;t get any dirtier or have any accidents while sleeping.
Waiting or fast travel on the other hand won&apos;t suspend the timers, so plan accordingly.
When players select to potty on a toilet they will need to press the attack/fire button at least once while seated. Failure to do so will result in the player not registering as having pottied. So don&apos;t be shy, fire away!
When the mod is first loaded it may take 2 to 3 minutes for some merchants to get their supply of lottery tickets and abraxo cleaner. Not every merchant will stock these items but I will tell you that chett at the good springs general store does. He is at the very bottom of the list though so it will take multiple iterations of the quest script for him to receive his supply.
All of this is subject to change at any time.

When you enter a new cell, or find a fixture that you want to replace click the Toilet Paper and select the desired option. If you are replacing toilets in your own home, or somewhere you wouldn\&apos;t expect to find random NPCs using the toilets, select the add toilets to my home option.
Sit on toilets will play a flushing sound when you or an NPC get up from them and walk away.
Urinals will play an unzip sound, peeing sound, and zip sound when used. To use a urinal simply walk up to it very close. Urinals are only for male characters, sorry ladies.
Tubs can sit two people. They will unequip your clothing, if you are wearing any, and play enter and leave splashing sounds. Upon leaving your clothing will be re-equipped. Placeable tubs will only do the above for the player due to some placement limitations. Replaced tube will do the above for the player and one companion, if two companions are in the tub only the first one entering will be affected.
If you decide you don\&apos;t want the placeable tub anymore open console, click it to show its id at the top of the screen and type, disable followed by the enter key, then MarkForDelete followed by the enter key. Repeat the process for the water mesh.
Companions with a sit option can use toilets.

Notes
-----
Why create this mod when at least one other mod with sit on toilets exists? When I came across these meshes I thought it was a good idea. Who wants to drink from a dirty toilet anyway? The mods I saw were replacer mods where the mod authors went in and hand replaced the old toilets with the sit on type. That can cause conflicts with other mods that change cells obviously, plus it doesn\&apos;t affect newly created cells from other mods.
After the initial release for FO3 I included usable urinals, and bathtubs. Even added placeable bathtubs that you can purchase from the merchant in the GoodSprings General Store. The items are called Dirty Tub, Clean Tub, and Cleanest Tub, and sell for 300, 600, and 1000 caps respectively. Tubs weigh 50lbs to add some realism (yes I know a cast iron tub like this would actually be a few hundred pounds).
To place a purchased tub Drop the item from the misc scetion of your inventory. The tub can then be placed using the z key. Once in position enter sneak mode and activate the tub to set yout new useable two person tub.
Tubs, the placeable kind and the replacements for existing tubs are scaled up a bit (to avoid some clipping, feet still stick through the bottom, sorry best I can do) so keep this in mind when placing them.
My approach, while a little more combersome, allows for greater compatability along with support for other mods.

Warning
--------  
This mod will disable existing toilets and tubs and replace them with the useable variety. Uninstalling this mod will leave you with an empty spot where they used to be. Be sure to activate the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp to replace those toilets, and leave it installed until you are sure all have been re-enabled.

Change Log
-----------
8-26-12: Changed the timers concerning the pee time variable. The new timer gives 12 hpurs before any warnings, then an additional warning each 3 hours. At the 21 hour mark an accident will happen if you do not find a toilet or use the No Pee chem. Be sure to reset hardcore mode using the Toilet Paper item to ensure the new timers are activated properly.
Added out houses as useable toilets. They function just like other toilets from this mod, but do not use the flushing sound. These out houses just have a script attached to the base object, so no need to run the Toilet Paper replacer function, they should work when activated.
Also added the Ultra Lux toilets to the replacer script, as it was pointed out I missed them in previous versions.
Lastly I added the ability to bathe in bodies of water, providing you have some Abraxo cleaner. To bathe in water bring up the pipboy and find the Toilet Paper aid item. Hole the zoom button (which should inform you that you can not drop quest items) And left click the Toilet Paper while still holding zoom. If you are in the water your armor should be removed, and the script will run just like in a bath tub cleaning the dirt over time. Only natural water bodies will work, not placeable water.
Previous update: Two new items are added to the camp fire menu
No-Pee
No-Poo
Each of these items will extend the time until your next bathroom visit. When using them your timer will be reset, but agailty penalty will remain until you find and use a toilet. Currently each recipe requires a dirty water, and either Broc Flower (for pee) or xander root (for poo).
5-22-12: Added an option to bind a hot key (of your selection) to display your current bathroom timers and mod penalties. Only available in hardcore mode obviously. If you elect not to bind a key, or later wish to change the key you selected, just restart hardcore mode.
5-14-12: Small change to the toilet script to prevent ladies from getting stuck while going No1. Previously pressing a directional control caused the script to halt leaving the player in a restrained state. Changed it to disable player controls while the sound is playing to avoid the issue. You will still not be able to get up until the sound stops, or a couple seconds after.
5-10-12: Fixed a couple script errors I found. Namely the dirt variable tracking, and the start/stop hardcore option. Should both work right now. Also found an interesting bug where the cha variable gats stored as -0.00, you can see this in the show stats option after you have restored charisma previously damaged from dirt. The game throws out this negative zero, then doesn\&apos;t know quite how to deal with it. I was able to get around the issue, but I find it interesting so I thought would mention it. 
5-9-12: Two new items, Fancy Shampoo, and Bath Beads. Both are sold by Old Lady Gibson, and the Street Vendor on the the Vegas Strip. When sold out they will restock in 7 game days. Having these items in your inventory while bathing will grant the Fresh Scent bouns, which boosts Charisma by 1 for 6 or 12 hours depending on if you have one or both items.
Fixed a bug where toilet sounds still played when pressing fire button even after getting up from the toilet.
Added splash sound when pressing the fire button while in tubs.
5-06-12: New Hardcore mode added.Not dependent on Hardcore mode selection in the game. Default is turned on, but you can turn it off in the toilet paper options menu if you prefer.
Players will have to use toilets, and tubs based on a time scale.
Peeing will need to be done once every 9 hours to avoid having an accident. At the 6 hour mark a message will be displayed \&quot;you need to pee 1\&quot;, and your agility will be decreased by 1. At 7 hours a message saying \&quot;you need to pee 2\&quot;, accompanied by another loss of 1 agility. * hour mark \&quot;you need to pee 3\&quot; agility -1. This is a total agility loss of 3 at this point. At the 9 hour mark a message saying \&quot;you wet yourself\&quot; will be displayed. At that point agility will return to normal, and your charisma will drop by .2 Peeing anytime before you wet yourself will reset agility, if any is lost, and reset the timer
Potty will have to be done once every 33 hours to avoid having an accident. Potty is treated the same as pee accept the times are 24, 27, 30, and 33. Each is accompanied by the -1 agility with the 33 mark restoring agility and decreasing charisma by 1.
Bathing will need to be done once a day to avoid a loss in character Charisma.It is handled on the same time scale as potty where 24 hours you get your first message that you need to bathe. Then every 3 hours you will get the message again. The first message results in a chariama drop of 1, and each following message at the 3 hour intervals results in an additional .2 loss to charisma. 
The dirt variable is used to track your total charisma loss due to having accidents, and not bathing. every point of dirt is equal to -.2 charisma.
Bathing is the only way to remove dirt and restore your charisma. While bathing you will restore .2 charisma every second you are in the tub. When dirt has been completely removed you will get a message box saying you are clean.
There are two items you will need to have in your inventory to use the toilets and tubs efficently. One is lottery tickets (for toilet paper) the other is abraxo cleaner (for tub bathing). Both of these items have been added to varions merchants throughout New Vegas and they will restock a few seconds after they run out. A full box of cleaner will remove about 60 dirt, and one lotto ticket will be used when using the toilets. Male characters only consume TP when going potty.
The menu has changed to add a few new options, and consolidate the old options. New is show status which will display the time you have to pee, potty, and bathe. It also displays your total dirt, charisma and agility penalties. There is also an option to turn off/restart the needs part of the mod. When turning off the feature your agility and charisma should be restored if they were lowered.
Sleeping will suspend your timers, so you shouldn\&apos;t get any dirtier or have any accidents while sleeping.
Waiting or fast travel on the other hand won\&apos;t suspend the timers, so plan accordingly.
When players select to potty on a toilet they will need to press the attack/fire button at least once while seated. Failure to do so will result in the player not registering as having pottied. So don\&apos;t be shy, fire away!
When the mod is first loaded it may take 2 to 3 minutes for some merchants to get their supply of lottery tickets and abraxo cleaner. Not every merchant will stock these items but I will tell you that chett at the good springs general store does. He is at the very bottom of the list though so it will take multiple iterations of the quest script for him to receive his supply. 
All of this is subject to change at any time.

There are two items you will need to have in your inventory to use the toilets and tubs efficently. One is lottery tickets (for toilet paper) the other is abraxo cleaner (for tub bathing). Both of these items have been added to varions merchants throughout New Vegas and they will restock a few seconds after they run out. A full box of cleaner will remove about 60 dirt, and one lotto ticket will be used when using the toilets. Male characters only consume TP when going potty.
The menu has changed to add a few new options, and consolidate the old options. New is show status which will display the time you have to pee, potty, and bathe. It also displays your total dirt, charisma and agility penalties. There is also an option to turn off/restart the needs part of the mod. When turning off the feature your agility and charisma should be restored if they were lowered.
Sleeping will suspend your timers, so you shouldn\&apos;t get any dirtier or have any accidents while sleeping.
Waiting or fast travel on the other hand won\&apos;t suspend the timers, so plan accordingly.
When players select to potty on a toilet they will need to press the attack/fire button at least once while seated. Failure to do so will result in the player not registering as having pottied. So don\&apos;t be shy, fire away!
When the mod is first loaded it may take 2 to 3 minutes for some merchants to get their supply of lottery tickets and abraxo cleaner. Not every merchant will stock these items but I will tell you that chett at the good springs general store does. He is at the very bottom of the list though so it will take multiple iterations of the quest script for him to receive his supply. 
All of this is subject to change at any time.

Credits
--------
This mod uses modified toilet meshes created by coneman at the Nexus web sites.
-------------
Installation
-------------
Extract the contents of this archive to the Fallout NV folder. Select the UseableToilets.esp in the data files section, and launch the game.
-------------
unistalling
-------------
Deselect the UseableToilets.esp and select the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp in the data files section. Keep the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp checked until all toilets have been replaced. If after that you find missing toilets just recheck the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp and re-enter the cell where you noticed them missing. The cell will have to load so you may need to change cells then come back.
Some of the static items are replaced as soon as this esp is activated, so place it as low as possible in the load order the first time it is run. After that you can move it higher if you need to.</thetext>

(I am no longer working on this mod, If anyone wishes to pick up were i left off feel free)
In a post-apocalyptic world one thing is the same as it was pre-apocalyps,Sex sells. Resources to trade in the wastes are hard to come by, so whats a girl to do? If you guessed hooking then you guessed right. Girls are poping up all over the place trying to earn a cap or two to pay the bills and Easy Pete isnt complaining cuz he now has somthing to look at other then the desert. Another great addition to the wastes is the new Golden Globes Porn studio were dreams come true and anyone can become a Star
More Adult Content or MAC for short is a attempt to bring alot more life and alot more \&quot;Sexy\&quot; to the wastes by adding Dancers/Hookers and sexual content in the form of quests and dialog to all corners of the game. 
( I have started working on the next part of the porn star quest, It mite take a little while cuz i want to make it good, Please keep up the great endorsments as these make me want to work even harder)
remember to check back often as i try to update and add content 2 or 3 times a week
MAC will work with all other mods that change cloths and appearence. MAC should work well with the mod \&quot;Populated Casino\&quot; but atm there is alot happening in atomics with MAC so you mite get a little lag or pathing problems if you run Populated Casino on high and are on a older machine.
(The optional MAC using the Sexual Innuendo animations (Beta) out now. tell me what you think or if you find any bugs. Credit for the animations go to the creator of the Sexual Innuendo mod. This optional version is a beta test. All my npc\&apos;s should be using the new animations. If people like and endorse this version i will add it to all the npcs I Create.)
You need to have the Sexual Innuendo mod for the optional version of MAC http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36659

[i]Simply put, this is a zombie mod, complete with infection, resurrection, a special zombie-killing challenge, and more :D[/i]
[color=red]**UPDATE**
New main file uploaded, and for those who downloaded a previous version there is also the new .esp alone; simply download that and replace the old one and have fun :D 
Features added: 
Updated the Necronomicon to move a Zombie Terminal to your location, allowing you to configure zombie settings to your pleasure, with a new ability to disable/enable special infected, a new rewards system with \&quot;Zombie Skulls\&quot; exchangeable for special weapons/armor
A new special infected called the \&quot;Infected Abomination\&quot; appears; when hit, it infects everyone around it, and on death it explodes in an infectious cloud.
Death effects return, with explosion and resurrection. Note that if you cripple the legs or head, they will not get back up.
[/color]
This mod allows you to have fun grinding your way through zombies, observing infection, etc in a way that I enjoy. Features of this mod include:
Zombies spawned at definite, strategic locations in order to maximize infection.
Fully-functional infection, with special effects applied to zombies (at a random chance, the zombies get back up after dying, or, they explode, releasing a cloud that infects all nearby non-zombified NPCs)
Diverse zombies, with a special \&quot;Pouncer\&quot; infected that knocks people down with its\&apos; power attack, making the target easy to kill by the horde.
Zombie Hunter Challenge; kill 50 zombies, and you get a special perk reducing the DT of zombies by 5!
Multiple spawning-points, such as Freeside, the Old Mormon Fort, the Strip, Casinos, Primm, Novac, Camp Golf, etc.
[b]How to enable infection[/b]:
[color=red]Go to the Old Mormon Fort in freeside.
Behind the sandbags, on the wooden planks is a copy of the Wasteland Survival Guide labeled \&quot;Necronomicon\&quot; in your interface for some reason.
Read it once to spawn a single zombie at your location, just to see what you\&apos;re up against, and then read it again to enable zombies all over the wasteland. [/color]

[url=http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35369]Populated Casinos[/url]
[url=http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37067]Zombie Apocalypse (By ZuluFoxtrot)[/url]
Note about Zombie Apocalypse:
To my understanding, ZuluFoxtrot\&apos;s Zombie Apocalypse should not conflict with my mod, and as my mod specializes in the infection of civilization and his population of the wasteland with zombies, I recommend you download his mod to use with mine, to enhance the atmosphere.
Installation/Uninstallation:
Installation:
Extract all files in the archive to your Fallout: New Vegas data folder.
Uninstallation:
Delete all files associated with my mod.
Have a pleasant apocalypse :D

          <long_desc isprivate="0">
            <thetext>http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=46460
6/2/12 - Uploaded another file for the 5.0 update to AWOP, just in case.
===
Simply renames the \&quot;M\&quot; modified weapons added by AWOP to use FOOK\&apos;s naming system. I replaced the M with X for aesthetic reasons. No other stats were changed.
I did my best, anyway.
Requires AWorldOfPain(Preview).esm as a master.

==============================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I had found the powerarmor , I was quite shocked about that like a little defense these offer.
Therefore, I have improved the defense of the T45d and the T51b and have placed of those weight on easily.
In addition, I have decreased the weight of the NCR armors and have raised the defense of the NCR-powerarmor and Rangerarmor.
If you just a fan are from the enclave like me, then you can add yourselves powerarmor in your inventory.
(The defense and the weight are modified)
Code for the powerarmor:
000CB5F3 = armor
000CB5F4 = helmet
Code for the teslaarmor:
0006B464 = armor
0006B465 = helmet
\&quot;ps: Arcade now use a plasmacaster\&quot;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: v_0_2
the version \&quot;Armor Fix - v_0_2\&quot; makes the remantspowerarmor, remnantsteslaarmor and the Gannonteslaarmor more useful.

===========   
Description   
=========== 
I was always put off by the fact that 90% of the population seemed to wear the exact same armor/clothing with the exact same hat as everyone else, the end of the world may have happened but that doesn\&apos;t mean everyone found and wears the exact same piece of clothing.
This mod aims to try and lessen this issue by adding more clothing/armor variety into the wasteland through the use of level lists.
This mod includes:
Backpacks: 11
Gloves: 21
Headgear: 47
Armors/Clothing: 29
Poncho: 7
============
Requirements
============
Fallout New Vegas patch: 1.4.0.525
Any Type3/Type6 Female Body: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34825
Robert Male Body: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39880
OR
Breezes New Vegas Males: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35451
----------------------
Optional but suggested:
----------------------
Wrye Flash NV (for a bashed patch): http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35003
or
FNVEdit (for a merged patch): http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703  
==========   
Plugins  
========== 
If you are updating from 0.7 to version 1.0, you do not NEED to make a clean save but I highly suggest you do so. To make a clean save you need to, find a safe indoor spot (no enemy respawns) and save. Now uninstall the mod, and load the save. save again. Now install the mod. Wait inside for 4 days so everyone\&apos;s level lists can reset.
If you do NOT do a clean save, please try and remove any Pickelhaube Helmets and Wasteland Survivor outfit from your inventory or your companion\&apos;s inventory before updating. Wait inside for 4 days so everyones level lists can reset after updating. 
----------------
Main plugins:
----------------
1nivVSLArmors.esp: This is the main plugin, it places items through out the game in level lists/vendors.
---------------------------
Optional player only plugin:
---------------------------
DO NOT USE this with the Diversified Mojave Wasteland patch.
Player only version: This is the player only version, it places the armors in boxes you find in Goodsprings and in vendors. There are no items found in level lists.
-------------------
Optional Patches:
-------------------
Optional patches require BOTH Spice Of Life AND the mod they patch to be installed and/or turned on.
................
Cheater Patch
................
1nivVSLArmors Cheat.esp: This is a patch that adds four boxes to Goodsprings, for those who want to cheat to get the items but also want the level list edits of the Main plugin. DO NOT USE this with the Optional player only plugin.
...................................................................
Breezes New Vegas Males: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35451
...................................................................
NivSpiceofLife Breeze Patch: This is a optional patch to make the armors fit Breeze\&apos;s male body, it may not be as up to date as the main file but will still work.
.......................................................................
Diversified Mojave Wasteland: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/42007
.......................................................................
1nivDWSLPatch.esp: This is a patch for the mod Diversified Mojave Wasteland, it provides much more diversity of items.
.........................................................
Project Nevada: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40040
.........................................................
1nivPNSLPatch.esp: This is a patch for the mod Project Nevada, it provides image overlays for headgear. To keep the night vision items added to be balanced, you only find broken versions off enemies. To make working versions go to the workbench, you need to repair them:
1 Broken item
2 Spare Parts
1 Fission Battery
3 Scrap Electronics
2 Sensor Module
=====================   
FAQ / Troubleshooting  
=====================
Q: Why are all the items invisible/or a red !?
A: You did not install the mod correctly, please take a moment to read through the installation section.
Q: My game crashes on start up.
A: You have installed a mod that does not have the required master installed. Please take some time and read through the plugin section.
Q: Where do you get the items in game?
A: You can find all items (but one) in game on random NPCs and through Vendors, the Zombieland outfit is only found in Chet\&apos;s store and rarely on other vendors.
A: If you use Player only version you can find all the items in some chests in Goodsprings. See picture for location.
Q: How long does it take for the items to show up in game?
A: About 4 days waiting will reset all NPC spawns that have already spawned, if you enter a new area that you have not been in before it should work right away.
Q. Will this work with Vanilla bodies?
A. No it will not work right, you will get splotches and skin issues if you use vanilla bodies with this mod.
Q. What about type 6?
A. Yes it will work with type 6 because they use the same textures as Type3.
Q. Does this work with the pipboy?
A. Yes, the new update makes it pipboy compatible.
Q. Why do some of the Project Nevada items take up the headband slot when they do not need to?
A. That is a requirement for some of the effects to work.
Q. Will this work with mods like Fook and Project Nevada?
A. It should work with mods that edit the level lists just put the mod you want to work last (or use a bashed/merged patch). Make sure you grab the PN patch.
Q: Is this mod compatible with?
A. If the mod adds items to the same level lists then it will conflict, nothing game breaking will happen simply which ever mod is lower in the load order will show up on that NPC. Try making a bashed or merged patch for best compatibility.
Q. Why do the gloves clip or have a gap?
A. That is just how the gloves where made, its a vanilla issue.
Q. Where can I find the Zombieland outfit or its not showing up at the store.
A. It is the only thing in this mod you can NOT find in the world level lists, you can buy it in Chet\&apos;s store and possibly other stores as well if your lucky.
Q. Do the boobs bounce?
A. No.
Q. I saw some face masks in your WIP pics why are they not in game?
A. Permission was currently denied.
Q. I think a item is unbalanced.
A. Please either post or pm me.
Q. Will you make this for FO3?
A. That is hard to say right now, this mod uses a ton of NV assets I would have to remove them and edit everything... we will see.

Sari-December\&apos;s Pose Pack
Fallout New-Vegas Version
__________________________________
This mod adds 50 custom, static poses that can be applied to PCs and NPCs.
This is the first release, I\&apos;m planning to expand the mod further and further. Everybody\&apos;s welcome to come up with requests, they maybe get incorporated into the next update! :)
___________________________________________________________________________________
How to use:
1. Enter third person camera (\&quot;F\&quot;-key or mousewheel)
2. Open the console (\&quot;^\&quot;-key) and type in \&quot;tfc\&quot;
3. Type in \&quot;player.playidle sdxx\&quot; [xx = number of pose (01-50)]
4. To apply the poses to NPCs, open the console as described above, select the NPC
   with a left mouse click, that his name appears at the top center of the screen.
   Type in \&quot;Playidle sdxx.
5. To reset the character, type \&quot;playidle reset\&quot;
6. That\&apos;s it!
For fans of the Gaijin4koma also known as \&quot;reaction guys\&quot; I included the 4 infamous memes in the gaijin1-4 poses, have fun!
For reference see the image section as well as my FO3 profile\&apos;s image-upload section!
___________________________________________________________________________________
Installation Guide:
Download the zipped archive, open it with e.g. 7zip and extract the files to your FalloutNV/data directory. Open FOMM or the \&quot;Data Files\&quot; tab in Fallout Launcher and place the checkmark next to \&quot;SariDPoses.esp\&quot;. GO! :D
UNinstallation Guide:
Delete SariDPoses.esp and the folder meshes\\characters\\_male\\idleanims\\SariDPoses.
___________________________________________________________________________________
Bugs &amp; Issues:
Some users encountered problems with \&apos;Sexual Innuendo\&apos;. Since I don\&apos;t support these kinds of mods, no patch will be provided here, but Sexual Innuendos Topic offers a short description on how to make that work.
Also this mod \&apos;conflicts\&apos; with mods that alter the weapon holding animations meaning that some poses won\&apos;t show up properly!
If anything else should show up, let me know!

[version 0.9.5d 13.09.2012]
[b][color=green][size=4]Currently:  Episode II - version 0.9.5d[/size][/color][/b]
[size=3]This mod completely supersedes [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46284]Episode I[/url], and is a complete standalone version.[/size]
[b][color=red][size=5]Make a CLEAN save before installing this mod[/size][/color][/b]
[b][color=orange][size=4]Introduction[/size][/color][/b]
The wasteland has a new band of slavers.  These aren\&apos;t just your normal band of raiders with sharp sticks.  They are organised and have numerous prison facilities in underground locations; allowing them to operate in secrecy under the noses of the wasteland population. 
The wasteland slavers only seem to be the tip of the iceberg.  Kidnapped citizens are disappearing entirely.  Never to be seen again.  Rumour has it that kidnapped citizens are being transported to an unknown location outside the wasteland, to an unknown fate.
This mod lets you live your life as a slave: captured and spiritied away in the night, you are thrown into a world beyond your control.  This mod adds a band of slavers to the Mojave wasteland. Adds prison facilities to the wastes and adds a whole new town in a remote location away from the Mojave. 
[b][color=yellow][size=3]Note:  This mod gives you a radically different gameplay experience.  If you want to be an all conquering, elite special forces ninja then this mod isn\&apos;t for you.[/size][/color][/b]

[b][color=red][size=5]Current Update Status[/size][/color][/b]
[b][color=orange][size=4]Version 0.9.5d uploaded 13.09.2012[/size][/color][/b]
Zippy is much faster now.
2 or more races will get the right response from sport.  Can sell the party pooper properly now
Increased stability during races.  Can prematurely talk to Sabiel without issue.
Sabiel\&apos;s body dump more robust.  Cleaned up leftover quest prompts.  Hopefully cured some Maggy wierdness.  Local Slavers won\&apos;t hang out like Jet whores anymore.  Theres no escape for Nose or Frank anymore.  The party pooper should be braver now and not run away.
[color=orange]No Patch file is currently needed - if you have one then delete it.[/color]
[b][color=orange]Update:  v0.9.5c 05.09.2012[/color][/b] changed some Ricky dialog.  Added a failsafe to the race so you cannot be resummoned whilst the race is running.  Added a check to see if the race has been running too long.  Added a more obvious spectator stand for the player.
[b][color=orange]Update:  v0.9.5b 03.09.2012[/color][/b] Added a water fountain to Maggy\&apos;s office.  Added a \&apos;Stay and Explore\&apos; option to the escape terminal.  Added some backup dialog to Maggy, for the rare times where she can run out of dialog (when she shouldn\&apos;t).  Added some savegames before entering Rubbletown for the first time and before the farm and police quests ( since you can get yourself killed quite easily ).  Fixed some minor oversights.
[b][color=orange]Update:  v0.9.5a 01.09.2012[/color][/b] Removed some testing tools, and added a plugin to correct GECK induced dialog trigger errors.

Version 2.0 BETA (Refer to older version readme.txt or old description at the end for additional information)
Before reading the description below, please take into account this version had been for some time a team effort to provide you with Quests. Evertaile was scripting and evolving quests and extra material for Rust Town in order for us to supply you a complete mod filled with everything. Right now and for some time I have lost communication with Evertaile, for reasons still unknown. For over 6 months developing was into stalemate. Taken that into account, a small part of some of the quests are unfinished. I lack the ability to script, so not only I could not effectively beta test current working quest scripts, but also have not been able to alter them in any way whatsoever in fear I brake something beyond repair. So, please feel free to provide feedback and bug reports, so I can write them down for future repair when I will be able to get some help.
For downloaders familiar with the old version 1.2: Rust Town has been expanded and is now more than doubled in size and number of interiors as I have also created a second district similar to the original but with a different theme. Quests are mostly taking place in vanilla Rust Town in which more interiors have been integrated and there shall be no inaccessible doors left out of use (main Rust Town). For a complete list of the interiors and places to visit please refer to the list below in section 1.X

2.0 Quests
There is a massive number of Quests featured in this mod by now. The community asked for quests, so we delivered. For the number of quests I cannot clarify nor provide you with much help for debugging -see prologue-. Also, there are many quests mostly related with the Slums district that are currently left on paper.
Quests will be initiated either by finding and commencing dialogue with certain NPCs, asking around, and there is also a number of quests in the form of bulletin board notes located into the community hall for easy finding.

5.0 Dev Team
Obliviongr,Evertaile &amp; Lingwei
If you have any questions related to this mod you can contact me and I will try to assist. If you are having issues related to quests, contact Evertaile though I cannot promise a response at this point. Also, as I have said before, my ability with scripting is zero.
[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5240/installissuescopy.jpg[/img]
6.0 Installation
Delete old version file which came as an .esp. Insert into data folder the new .esm master file along with the extra .esp. When more development is complete, everything will be contained in a master file and from then on .esp as patches.
7.0 Bugs and Feedback
7.1. Everataile has managed to fine tune the mod to run more decently at lower end machines. Most bugs, where could be found, in old version were fixed. Issues we had trouble replicating are still a mystery. Also, Evertaile have contacted other mod authors to fix some compatibility issues our mod was having. Most of which are now resolved except one. Rust Town still has issues when running the same time with the mod: “Vault32fix”. Also take into account current state beta testing is somewhat lacking due to loss contact with Evertaile. –said that again didnt I?
7.2. Seems like since Quests came into play, for unknown reasons, some weird AI behavior have been observed. Minor things though, like some residents will occasionally sleep in random places instead of their owned houses. 
7.3. Doctor Tara is still broken and will not heal you whatsoever, so do not waste your buck. 
7.4. I have witnessed certain door teleporters vanish out of a sudden but all should be working by now. All of the doors should take you somewhere as I have made use of all of them.
7.5. There has been effort to correct any grammatical and spelling mistakes in dialogues to some extend, but since English is not my first language the occasional weirdness will probably strike you.
7.6. Some characters will not initiate dialogue with player and may cause weird behavior.
7.7 Strip Club is lacking background music files, will be updated.
7.8 Normally, since i stopped working on the mod since March, there is bound to be some incompatibilities I am not aware of.
7.9 First of the bat, incompatible with a mod called Warzones. (noted)
I will keep the above list updated and add bugs you report.
-------------------
-------------------
-------------------
Past / Old Description (January 2011)
-------------------
Rust Town. It is a lore friendly town complete with everything one will ever need. It is packed with amenities and numerous places of interest to explore and immerse yourself. 
My goal while working on this project was to provide a realistic town, full with detail and a unique fallout feel.
---------------------
Version 1.10
As of  version 1.1, I fixed some bugs and minor issues and added some extra vendors and a thing or two.
I would also like to thank the community for its support and the people that pointed out bugs and suggested some extra stuff and features.
Fixes:
1. Fixed Paula s dialogue and behavior 
2. Fixed a particular door that used to lead into nowhere
3. Some weird behavior some items had in the players house.
4. Replaced the sink in players house and is now useable and the toilet is as well rad-free.
Added content:
1. Tom, the town engineer, now sells spare crafting materials.
2. Eustathius the entomologist now sells some particular items like poison glands e.t.c.
3. Added a chemistry set in the clinic, for people with mods that make it useable.
4. Added dialogue to 5 more npcs.
5. An addict in town now sells spare medical equipment.
Cut non visible-references:
As people suggested I have cut down some references that were not visible but where left for future implementation and were behind some inaccessible doors. As the mod is heavy as it is, all added content from now on will be located in extra interior cells.
NOTES: [UPDATE 18.01.2011]
1. As of 16th of January I have teamed up with Evertaile in order to implement quests and provide you people with better content, quests, material and of course more places to explore.
[img][/img]
Conflicts:
Current version is apparently sometimes conflicting with:  the mod \&quot;armoror\&quot; and \&quot;vault32fix\&quot; Respected authors have been contacted and next update will be issue-free.
Installation:
Unpack archive, copy the extracted RustTownV1-1.esp file into your Fallout New Vegas DATA folder and enable the .esp using the vanilla launcher or FOMM. If you have previously downloaded Version 1.00 delete old file first.
Uninstall:
Just delete RustTownV1-1.esp from your data folder
---------------------
HOW TO REACH THE TOWN
The town is currently located to the far South West of the map west of Mojave Outpost. You can not reach it by foot at first because of the blocked road, but only by train.
Travel to the Vanilla EMERGENCY RAILWAY STATION, located in your pipboy. It is just southeast of POWDER GANGER CAMP SOUTH, and follow the railway tracks. A train will be waiting for you in the station to take you to Rust Town. After one trip, you can use fast travel to travel fourth and back, or keep using the railway stations. Walk to the second wagon behind the engine train and interact with it to travel. (I have included an extra, ready to use explored, map-marker near the station for those who might be having problem locating the vanilla one.) 
THE TOWN
Current population: 28
So far, current .esp consists of:
1. Rust Town Outdoor Environment. Full of detail, themed lighting, dark mood, and lots of beautifully created unique environments and sections all packed in a single monstrous cell, fully navmeshed.
2. Dynamic NPC Population. A wide variety of NPCs, like Sheriff, Deputies, Merchants, Barkeepers, Guards, Residents, Engineers, Doctors, Bums, dogs e.t.c., most of which keep an everyday schedule and some of them have extensive dialogue. 
3. Services. Certain NPCs will offer services (Buying/Selling, Repairing, Healing e.t.c.)
4. A Restaurant, to sit and grab a bite. Pick your table.
5. A Bar, to sit and enjoy your cocktails while admiring the view.
6. A Clinic, to stop by and heal your addictions, cleanse your radiation or patch up your crippled limps.
7. A Wildlife Exhibition Gallery, to check out captured wildlife, like cazzadors, geckos, mongrels, ants, rats etc.
8. Players House of course, for you to store your fancy equipment and get some rest.
9. Sheriffs Office with Jail. Behave and leave the prisoner alone.
10. Community Hall. This is where the townspeople meet and discuss their issues.
11. Barracks and Armory. All the guards and deputies need some rest too, right? Now with an implemented armory but not easy to reach.
12. Power Station. The town requires a steady supply of electricity. An engineer attends to this place everyday.
13. Five (5) unique Resident Houses (for the lucky ones that managed to secure a place with a roof, the rest have other means of housing)
14. Livestock Pen. Provides a steady supply of milk and meat.
Also, as a necessary part of the mod, i included:
15. Train Station with guess what… a train fully operational so one can travel back and forth to the city if you don’t want to make use of fast travel. (Currently the train station is located in the Mojave Region, at the vanilla EMERGENCY RAILWAY STATION outer cell, which I had to modify a little and bring it back to life in order to accommodate the train wagons). Also you’ll have to use it at least once to unlock Rust Town’s map marker. 
16. Rust Towns Train Station and outer Gate, trains need to travel from station to station right?
Issues:
While travelling with the train to Rust Town, and upon arrival, your companions will spawn at some distance outside the Town Train Station for some reason. SOLUTION: Just fast travel to your current location (RustTown mapmarker) and they will spawn right next to you. Same if you travel back to Mojave. I will need to look more into this.
On a side note: 
1. As the city is heavily populated and full of detail I experienced some small frame drop issues while beta testing in certain parts of it. Though take note, my computer is two years old. I expect some feedback on this frame drop by you guys. Maybe I will add a lighter version too if enough downloaders request it.
2. Because of the Cazadors behavior and flying animation they sometimes seem to momentarily noclip through their holding tank. But it’s just visual, they can’t get out.
3. The doctor goes to her resident every night to rest. Check back in the morning if you need her services.
4. Tom the handyman, does weapon and armor repairs, if you need his services he will either be wandering, sleeping or, during morning hours, working in the power station.
5. The merchants, barkeepers and restaurant cashiers work 24/7.
6. There are no quests involved as i am not familiar with scripting. Maybe if i get some help something can be worked out.
7. A workbench and a reloading bench can be found inside the Power station.
8. Some doors in the town are inaccessible as I have future plans implementing more stuff.
9. Town lighting is part of the mood I wanted to create. Though screenshots may seem darker than the actual environment, if enough people request a brighter environment I may upload an extra .esp file.
10. The lawmen in the town are a little toughened up in comparison to usual vanilla npcs, so take notice.
11. I excluded npcs carrying energy weapons and spiced em up with wild west weaponry as part of the town’s concept.
12. I had to place a few collision markers in some tight spaces that would get player character stuck behind houses and walls at the outer perimeter of the town. I would have closed all gaps with visual references but, by the end, the mod had already become a little heavy for my cpu and maybe for others.
13. Zero use of scripting. Use of G.E.C.K. provided tools only. I wish I did use scripts for the mod to be more interactive and dynamic but I’m not familiar with scripting.
Things to come:
1. More dynamic NPC behavior, more dialogue. Also, maybe voice overs (if I have the time and courage. The voice actors are no issue as I have already gathered enough candidates). 
2. Right now I am planning on paper for an adults only kind of themed interior cell and the Town Library, maybe later a place of worship and an underground cemetery.
3. Possibility of extending current town infrastructure to the third level up. Of course if, as is, the town is giving people bad frames per second I will scrap that idea.
4. Extending the Wildlife Exhibition Gallery to contain more animals and insects, add more rooms and sections.
Personal notes:
The heaviest work: Town inner outdoor Environment (not taking into consideration the inner cells) ~ 8 straight hours working on paper, ~118 straight hours to complete in G.E.C.K. Not a stone unturned.
The best way to create new environments is: (A) Plan ahead, draw your ideas on the paper considering what assets the game can provide. (B) Knowing exactly the vanilla assets. Knowing where to find what you need and the variations of it. (C) Master the controls of G.E.C.K. (D) Do not let yourself down. 
Working with G.E.C.K. is surely creative and gravely time consuming. If you love what you’re doing, believe in it, and want your imagination to come to life through a game mod, you occasionally find yourself working around the clock creating unique environments, doing night swifts.
I hope at least some of you guys provide feedback, suggest ideas, point me my mistakes and tell me how to make my mod any better. Take into account this is my 1st mod I ever uploaded, though I fiddled with G.E.C.K. back in Fallout 3.
Contact me if you need anything or have any questions.
English is not my first language, I am sorry for any grammatical and spelling mistakes. Thanks in advance.</thetext>

[color=Blue][size=3]Name          : [/size][/color]Compatibility Patch for Umpa\&apos;s FNV Dance Animations
[color=Blue][size=3]Version       : [/size][/color]1.0

[color=Blue]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=Blue][size=4]Description:[/size][/color]
[color=Blue]-------------------------[/color]
This mod patches Umpa\&apos;s FNV dance animations to make them compatible with Animated Prostitution, WSEX module (used by Sexual Innuendo and other mods) 
[color=Blue][size=4]Detail:[/size][/color]
[color=Blue]--------------------[/color]
This override patch renames the DancerFaction and KnockdownIdles in 7DanceFNV to be unique, thus avoiding conflicts with other mods that use KnockdownIdles.
(for example, sex animations not working -- both particpants stand, overlapping, making grunting noises)
[color=Blue][size=4]---Installation:---[/size][/color]
[color=Blue]--------------------------------[/color]
[color=Blue][size=3]Manual Installation:[/size][/color]
[color=Blue]---------------------------------[/color]
Unzip the ftc7DanceFNVCompatibilityPatch.esp file into your FNV Data directory.
USE FOMM to activate (or other mod manager)
Place this in load order AFTER 7DanceFnV.esp.
AnimatedProstitution esp should be after this mod.
Others- you may have to experiment with load order.
[color=Blue][size=4]---Uninstallation:---[/size][/color]
[color=Blue]----------------------------------[/color]
[color=Blue][size=3]Manual Uninstallation:[/size][/color]
[color=Blue]-----------------------------------[/color]
Uncheck ftc7DanceFNVCompatibilityPatch.esp in FOMM ( or whatever you use )
Delete ftc7DanceFNVCompatibilityPatch.esp.

I made a few dresses for females that are very very skimpy. i was inspired by real pictures of models  that i have seen around. i used a modified version of the type 3 body, nothing drastic just bigger bust and butt. If you already have type 3 and any of the textures i have seen around the nexus it should work fine. I plan on adding more variants and color as time goes on. this is hopefully just a taste of things to come
So far there are two styles of dresses in a few different color styles. There is a Corset outfit and a skimpy fishnet like dress.
Outfits are located in the Lucky 38 ground level in a suitcase up by the bar on the north side.
Installation should be fairly simple just place meshes, textures and ESP file in your data folder and allow the two folders to merge.
Known Bugs;
I accidentally cut like two polygons off the right ankle of the body mesh. i will be fixing that as soon as possible.
What i plan for the future:
more variants and new dresses
fixes to clipping fixes.
better textures
I know this probably doesn\&apos;t fit lore and i don\&apos;t care so lets not start with that. :D
I look forward to your input and feedback. Any suggestions and bug reports are appreciated
Thanks to;
Thanks to Dimon99 for the Type 3 body

1. Description
2.Updates and COMPLETION RATE
3. BETA Release

6 OTHER MODS IM WORKING ALONGSIDE (PLEASE READ)
7.) BUGS
PlEASE FEEL FREE TO UPLOAD YOUR OWN IMAGES.
1.) Description
This mod is taking New Vegas to another level, taking away some of the borders, this mod lets you go into the open wastes, except now they arnt so empty.
New places, new enemies.........and more importantly many  more hours gameplay
What this mod adds:
- 2 new enemies (build in blender, 1 is the Tyrant based on the old resident evil games tyrant and the other is another deadly creature which ill let you discover for yourself)
Also adds one creature to the Asylum, which is a remodelled version of an existing creature.
- 3 new marked quests so far
- Around 20 new dungeons ( some in next release)
- 1 large new town (complete with traders and NPC scedules and conversations) , 1 large NCR base plus many other locations including ranger outposts, a crashed airliner and many many more unique locations (created from scratch will no copy and pasting of other interiors!)
- Terrain ranging from dust storm swept deserts in the south.....to towering mountain ranges as the map heads north, hiding deadly snipers and other terrors.
- Many new NPCs
- Custom meshes and textures (A Few new items (so far))
- An easily accessable map marker by the mojave outpost (bottom left) of the map, which takes you out of the main map area. (although the borders are removed in that region, this is in case you have problems)
Also one of my main concerns with this mod is conflictions with other mods, If another mod\&apos;s scenary / towns conflicts please let me know as I will most definantly want to work around those areas so that more mods are compatible with mine.
So far the only mod that has conflicted is Rust Town. However this has proven to be an easy get around as I can simply place scenery around that modded area so it is accessable and the mods are compatible.
PLEASE. Do not put any comments saying youve got to a point where theres empty land / companions / enemies stand still,
This is because you will eventually reach a place where I havent modded and those areas wont be navmeshed meaning only the player can enter those regions.
This mod also adds interiors to the airport at the south of the map and gives the crashed vertibird an interior.
2.) UPDATES AND COMPLETION RATE
6 / 3 /2011
Ive decided not to continue this mod, there are plenty of new areas to be explored already so I think this mod can stand as it is, sorry folks.
Ive uploaded a new update which fixs a few bugs
UPDATES BEFORE THIS POINT HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO SAVE SPACE.
3.) BETA RELEASE
Nothing further on this
4.)TEAM
Help and team (contact me if you wish to help)
Me( thelonewarrior)
I do scrpting to an average level, im no expert but I know quite a bit.
Making new areas, and some new models.
pest109
My official quest/ writer of whats going down in my mod storywise.
needed:
Someone trained at least basically in blender for new models
Texture creator / editor (needed for new vault clothing)
5.) Credits
Myself (for creating new creature models in blender( they are from an old account I used for fallout 3 nexus but wanted a better name, my old account was ukguy19)
vivanto for their vertibird interior resource found here:

http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=7976
6.) OTHER MODS THAT WILL BE COMPATIBLE
Im trying my best to work with other modders so most mods will be compatible with my own, all i want is for everyone to be able to have a great experience with my mod +others and not have to choose between those mods.
ALSO to make things clear, as im working alongside other mods for maximum compatibility, im only doing the westside (which is huge, I estimate once finished 30hours more gameplay at least) and the east where Ceasers camp is and possibily the south as well.
But the northern areas are other modders projects and to avoid conflictions there will be no content there from my mod
Im working with the following modders to maximise compatibility (or have already made them compatible)
Open Worlds Mod (FULLY COMPATIBLE AT THE MOMENT, but as my mod and that mod draw closer ill be working a lot harder to make sure they work perfectly)
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39130
RUST TOWN (FULLY COMPATIBLE)
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39454
WORD OF PAIN MOD (FULLY COMPATIBLE)
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38719
7.) BUGS
The was a bug reported where none of the new NPCs had dialogue, I seem to have fixed this but please tell me if it happens again.
This also stopped the quest from working correctly, but it should be ok now.</thetext>

[color=yellow]This is a port of the Fallout 3 mod of the same name (available [url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10183]here[/url]). A few things to note:

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
The Dragonskin Tactical Outfit mod actually adds a selection of the titular outfits - in different colours and camo patterns - to the Wasteland. It is loosely based on the real Dragon Skin body armour apparently in use today by SWAT teams, Secret Service and other elite military personnel. During testing this armour withstood multiple assault rifle bullet impacts and even point-blank hand grenade blasts.
The mod also adds matching \&apos;Dragon\&apos; Combat Helmets, plus Combat Backpacks (that increase the maximum weight the wearer can carry), M40 Gas Masks (that provide some radiation resistance to the wearer), Tactical Goggles and Balaclavas to complete the look.
The player will not need to find (or purchase) more than one outfit to be able to use it in different camo configurations: much cheaper and lighter \&apos;camo covers\&apos; for the armour and helmets allow the player to swap the camo type used by the outfit whenever they wish.
The outfits themselves are quite expensive, but offer fantastic protection: they are intended to be amongst the best armour available in-game; before stepping up to power armour, that is. For the sake of comparison (with default game values), the outfits offer slightly more protection than Reinforced Combat Armour, but not as much protection as Reinforced Combat Armour Mark 2. The outfits also increase the maximum weight the wearer can carry, and offer mild bonuses to the Small Guns and Sneak skills.
Outfit and Helmet Camo Types:
- Black
- Desert
- NCR (Considered NCR Faction clothing, not part of camo-swapping system)
- Urban
- Winter
- Woodland
Backpack Camo Types:
- Black
- Brown
- Desert
- Grey
- Olive Drab
- Tan
- Urban
- White
- Winter
- Woodland

2. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas
- [OPTIONAL] New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE) v1.0 Beta 1 or above. Get it from here: http://nvse.silverlock.org
========================
3. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Installation:
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the DragonskinTacticalOutfit.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool - place a tick in the box next to DragonskinTacticalOutfit.esp.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. Try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
- [OPTIONAL] If you want NCR Rangers to have the chance to spawn with NCR-variant Dragonskin Outfits and/or Dragon Helmets, place a tick in the box next to DragonskinNCRPersonnelWearingOutfits.esp in the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool. DragonskinNCRPersonnelWearingOutfits.esp must load *after* DragonskinTacticalOutfit.esp - changing the load order of plugins is easiest to do using a mod manager tool.
- [OPTIONAL] If you have not already done so, download and install NVSE (http://nvse.silverlock.org). Be sure to read and follow the NVSE documentation *closely*.
- [OPTIONAL] If you do not want to use the modified pistol equip/unequip animations included with this mod, delete the 1hpequip.kf, 1hpholster.kf, 1hpunequip.kf, sneak1hpequip.kf and sneak1hpunequip.kf files from your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_male\\ directory after installing this mod - or do not install these files to begin with.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - DTO).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Updating from an earlier version:
- Install the files from the newer version (following the installation instructions above) over the top of the files from the older version - clicking \&apos;Yes to All\&apos; (or equivalent) when Windows asks if you wish to overwrite files and folders.
- Check your load order. Updating plugins can change your load order.
- Update your merged patch if you use one (see Automatic Merged Patch Creation, above).
- Resume play: no other steps required.
Uninstallation:
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool - clear the tick in the box next to DragonskinTacticalOutfit.esp (and DragonskinNCRPersonnelWearingOutfits.esp, if it was also activated).
- If desired, delete all files copied to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory during installation (check the DragonskinTacticalOutfit.7z archive file to identify these files).
=====================
4. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
Dragonskin Tactical Outfits, Dragon Combat Helmets, Camo Covers, Balaclavas, M40 Gas Masks and Tactical Goggles can be either purchased or found in certain locations in the Mojave Wasteland. They can be purchased from these merchants:
188 Trading Post		- Alexander
Brotherhood Of Steel	- Torres
Camp McCarran Supply Shack	- Contreras
Gun Runners HQ		- Vendortron
Hoover Dam		- Bardon
Mojave Outpost		- Lacey
Finding the outfits, helmets, camo covers, gas masks and balaclavas in the Wasteland may prove more difficult. They are highly prized, and will likely only be found in well-secured armouries, caches and strongholds; places that may be difficult (or impossible) for very low-level characters to access.
Dragonskin Tactical Camo Covers can be used to swap the camo pattern used by a Dragonskin Tactical Outfit and Dragon Combat Helmet. To do so, follow these steps:
1) Ensure that the outfit and/or helmet you want to change is equipped.
2) Activate the Outfit or Helmet Camo item you wish to apply (they are found in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy).
The new camo pattern will be applied to your outfit/helmet, and the old pattern will be added to your inventory as another outfit/helmet camo item that can be later re-applied if you wish to return the outfit/helmet to how it looked earlier.
Note that this camo-swapping system will only work if you have NVSE installed (see the installation instructions above). Users without NVSE can still use the mod as normal - but the camo-swapping system will simply not work until/unless NVSE is installed (and a message will appear saying as much, if the user attempts to use a camo cover).
Note also that the NCR variant of the DTO outfit is not included in the camo-swapping system, as it was found to interfere with the game\&apos;s faction disguise system. See the Known Issues section for more information.
The Dragonskin Tactical Outfit incorporates a thigh holster for pistols, and the mod includes modified pistol draw/holster animations to make pistols sit in the holster when holstered, rather than on the waist as in default Fallout New Vegas. See the installations instructions above if you do not want to use these modified animations.
The optional DragonskinNCRPersonnelWearingOutfits.esp plugin adds the chance for NCR Rangers to spawn with Dragonskin Tactical Outfits and/or Dragon Combat Helmets (NCR camo variants). Note that this is only a *chance* for NCR Rangers to spawn with these items - and it does not affect regular NCR troops, or Elite Rangers; only NCR Rangers.

5. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in DTO in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to make gameplay (and aesthetic) additions to Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) But I want to talk about the real-world Dragon Skin body armour! Will you give a flying firetruck if I start talking about this?
A) No I will not.
Q) Will/can you make a version of the mod where the camo-swapping system doesn\&apos;t require NVSE?
A) No, it\&apos;s not possible; sorry.
Q) I\&apos;m having trouble with NVSE. Can you help me?
A) No - I am not part of the NVSE team; you\&apos;ll need to contact them regarding issues with NVSE.
Q) Where can I find Dragonskin Tactical Outfits in a specific camo type? (Eg: black, desert, urban, etc.)
A) The camo types found - both for sale by merchants and in the game world - are determined randomly. The DTO Bonus Pack (downloaded separately) gives greater control in obtaining specific camo types, so you may want to try that if you really want a particular type *right now*.
Q) Will you add a camo-swapping system for the Combat Backpacks?
A) Possibly.
Q) Is DTO compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) DTO should be compatible with almost all other mods. I have, however, listed the base objects edited by this mod in the \&apos;Conflicts/Known Issues\&apos; section below, to help users and modders determine for themselves whether a specific mod will conflict with DTO or not.
Q) Is DTO compatible with [insert name of body-replacer here]?
A) Dragonskin Tactical Outfits cover the body entirely (no bare skin), so the mod should be compatible with all body-replacers.
Q) Is there a female version of the Dragonskin Tactical Outfit?
A) Yes, there is; and it can be seen in some of the promo images that (should be) on the page where you downloaded DTO. The outfit is not particularly revealing or form-fitting, however, so don\&apos;t expect the female version to look overwhelmingly \&apos;feminine\&apos;.
Q) I don\&apos;t like the changes you\&apos;ve made in DTO v1.1. Can I have the old version back please?
A) That\&apos;s a shame. For the record, the changes made in DTO v1.1 were highly requested over a long time period (and were things I wanted myself too). As for access to the old version, it\&apos;s obviously within your power to just keep it and not upgrade to the latest version. I *could* make it available for download as a resource if lots of people want it, but that\&apos;s sort of messy, so I\&apos;d prefer not to.
Q) My character\&apos;s head/face is clipping through the balaclava/gas mask. Can you fix this?
A) No (and please see the Known Issues section below for more information). Earlier versions of DTO had goggles integrated into the balaclava itself in order to fully hide the head and side-step this issue. Lots of people (including myself) didn\&apos;t like the goggles being integrated like that, so I changed it. Unfortunately there\&apos;s a necessary compromise here; certain head/face shapes will have clipping issues.
Q) Is DTO compatible with Kenkuro\&apos;s Holster Animations mod?
A) At the time of writing it is (to the best of my knowledge). DTO uses animation files from Kenkuro\&apos;s Holster Animations mod, so using both it and DTO at the same time is fine since they are the same files.
Q) What do I do with the file I downloaded? It\&apos;s an unknown file type/I don\&apos;t know what to do with 7z files.
A) You need a program like 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org) or WinRAR (http://www.rarlab.com) to open the file you downloaded. After you have that, follow the installation instructions above.
Q) Why is New Vegas crashing/stalling on startup?
A) This is usually caused by a load order issue. Check the load order information in the Installation Instructions section of the DTO readme - and the readmes for any DTO add-ons you may be using. Also, do NOT rename any DTO plugins - especially DragonskinTacticalOutfit.esp.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the DTO mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that DTO wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. Along with the DragonskinTacticalOutfit.esp file, you also need to place the [meshes] and [textures] directories from the DragonskinTacticalOutfit.7z archive file into your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. Click on \&apos;Yes To All\&apos; if a window pops up asking you if you want to replace files and folders (you won\&apos;t lose anything). Also (in the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues) make sure you\&apos;ve followed the ArchiveInvalidation part of the Installation Instructions above - on the outside chance that this is the cause.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the items added by this mod so I don\&apos;t have to purchase or go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of DTO.
Q) I\&apos;m making my own changes/mod using DTO assets and I\&apos;m getting text on the outfit saying things like \&apos;upper arm right\&apos; and \&apos;back flap\&apos;. How do I get rid of that text?
A) Those are placeholder textures for \&apos;patches\&apos; that can be added to the outfit. To make them invisible, assign the \&apos;NullTextureSet\&apos; texture set to those mesh sections (\&apos;Arms:3\&apos;, \&apos;Arms:4\&apos; and \&apos;UpperBody:10\&apos;).

6. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to de-activate this mod.
============================
7. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- Some imperfect rigging - notably around the shoulders and knees. I consider it to be better than earlier versions of the mod, but these are very common problem areas for rigging; you\&apos;ll see problems in these areas in many outfits from the base game too.
- Certain head shapes may clip through the balaclava. Also some clipping in the chin area when wearing both balaclava and gas mask at the same time. Unavoidable without creating worse problems in other areas.
- Particularly bushy beards will likely clip through the balaclava and gas mask. Some hairstyles may also clip through the balaclava, albeit (and oddly) only when also wearing a Dragon Combat Helmet (and possibly other helmets; not tested). Many hairstyles will undoubtedly clip through the gas mask (straps) if it is worn without a balaclava.
- It was discovered during testing that if a Balaclava is worn at the same time as a Dragon Combat Helmet (or other helmets, possibly - not tested), the helmet will not take durability damage, but the Balaclava will. I imagine this is due to both these objects being technically \&apos;helmets\&apos; from the game\&apos;s point of view.
- The Dragonskin Tactical Outfits, Combat Backpacks and M40 Gas Mask use relatively high-poly meshes and high-res textures, and so may cause performance issues on lower-end computers if (say) given to an army of companion NPCs. These would almost certainly have to be computers that struggle to run New Vegas generally, though.
- Dragonskin Tactical Outfit (NCR) is unfortunately not covered by the DTO camo-swapping system, as it interfered with the game\&apos;s faction disguise system. I couldn\&apos;t see a way around this without having to re-write the whole faction disguise system (and no, I\&apos;m not going to do that).
- Efforts were made to make this mod as conflict-free as possible, but it *may* conflict with mods that also alter these base objects:
- FactionGearNVNCR (Form List)
- NVTravelLightBadArmorList (Form List)
- Pistol holster animations (replaces vanilla animation files - optional, though, as noted in the installation instructions above)
- Several cells had containers added to them; some in playable space, some not (no other changes made to cells). I would list specifics, but they would constitute spoilers. They are easily discovered by opening the plugin in the GECK or FNVEdit, in any case.
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between DTO and other mods that also alter these base objects (the list objects, at least).

This is a Small Jail/apartment I made for myself in GoodSprings, Basically it is an underground jail holding cell for all the slaves/companions junk I felt the need to be locked up and kept in a secure location while I explore. 
Nothing too fancy just a small apartment, plus 4 jail cells connected with one big inner cell. A latch  door in the back of the abandoned house on the right of Docs to enter and a latter latch door to exit. 
Someone wanted to know more about it so here goes.
You enter the latch and you end up in the main \&quot;Master\&quot; Bedroom, it has a small kitchen with stove and fridge a bathroom with sink and toilet and 3-4 lockers, and a table and chairs. There is a queen sized bed and a locker next to the bed with the key to the jail. There is a divider between the bathroom and the bedroom. Once you enter the jail you are in the main cell, it has a mattress in the middle just incase any of your slaves need punishment  it also has a couch and a table and chairs along with some shelving 2 tables and a desk. The 4 jail cells contain bunk beds/containers/toilets. 
Thats about All really no cheating items or money or anything, just a place to keep your stuff.
Everything is Vanilla, it\&apos;s only a small esp file. I tried to keep the latch in a place that could be possible and not in the middle of the road. 
Basically I duplicated a vanilla jail, deleted all the trash and things that I didn\&apos;t want, added a few things, changed the doors around, etc etc. And ended with this. 
HOW TO LOCK SLAVE INTO CELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is a way to lock the cell door on the slave and this is how.
First download slave in pose or any other pose mod install it and follow these directions.
Download the slave pose mod here-WARNING ADULT CONTENT IN PICTURES-http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38356, it is not difficult to use or install.
So with slave pose mod installed you would do this.
1) lead your slave into the cell near to the door inside.
2) Go into Console by pressing ~ 
3) Typing in TFIK and pressing enter
4) Still in Console Clicking on the Npc slave and seeing their name appear in the top middle screen.
4) Still in console Typing in Playidle t01-t79 (I think for slave pose)
5) Pressing enter
6) Exit console by pressing ~ 
7) Slave is now in Pose
8) Exit and close the door on the slave and face the slave again through the door (you outside her inside)
9) Enter console click on the door till you see the name of the door in the top middle and type Lock into console and press enter
10) Door is now locked, and you can release the slave from the pose by talking to them and telling them to wait there, they can\&apos;t exit.
I don\&apos;t know how to script or anything so this is the only work around I can think of, it seems kind of hard but actually it\&apos;s not.</thetext>

[b]7th Sep 2011[/b]
If you use OFT (recommended), then use of this mod is now deprecated.
All of the IWR data has been combined into [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41094]Operation Fixed Terrain v3+[/url].
Using the OFT merged files means you\&apos;ll have less files in your load order, and less bookmarks to track for updates.  Win-Win :)
===============
Name: Invisible Wall Remover
Author: Urbex / tunaisafish
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 7 Jul 2011
Category: Miscellaneous 
===============
Description:
===============
Disables the invisible walls around the wasteland that stop access to the outskirts of the map.
Ideally it will serve as a community resource and influence expansion of New Vegas far into the Mojave.
===============
Installation:
===============
Drop both files into your Data folder and enable them in your launcher.
Uninstall is reverse of above.
Note: If you use the Operation Fixed Terrain mod, then the IWR-Rebuilt file is not required.
===============
Details:
===============
Invisible Walls (also known as collision markers) have the [i]sole[/i] purpose of providing physical data to the world.
They provide 2 benifits in the game.
1. To keep your player in the play-area.  Most of the worldspaces are bordered with IW\&apos;s.
2. To ease the load on the havok physics engine.  More complex multivertex shapes are normally surrounded by the much simpler IW\&apos;s.
This mod only disables the walls that impede travel to places that you should really be able to access.
===============
Compatibility:
===============
Use BOSS/FOMM to handle load order, or load as early as possible to allow other mods to override specific locations.
Also recommend [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41094]Operation Fixed Terain[/url].  Again, load OFT after IWR.
===============
Bugs/Issues:
===============
Slight caveat.  This mod essentially allows you to explore regions of the map that were only intended as decoration. So it\&apos;s possible that your character may become stuck in terrain (eg. between some rocks).  If this happens, use the console and type \&apos;tcl\&apos; to disable collisions.  Walk out of the problem area then re-enable collisions using the same console command; tcl.
If you use the included \&apos;IWR - Rebuilt.esp\&apos; file too, then you should not find many of these places.
If you do then please report the location.  Ideally stating the coordinates or the problem.
AWZ\&apos;s [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42166]Coordinate Finder[/url] mod can help with that if you don\&apos;t know how.
===============
History:
===============

IIWR 2.0.0
Modified the entire wasteland, excluding Cistern, Nellis AFB, Boulder City, and The Hoover Dam due to quest restraints

IWR 1.0.1 FormID\&apos;s changed to reflect the changes made by Obsidian patch 1.3

===============
Credits:
===============
Urbex - for the original release and days and days of care and development put into it.
Urbex - again! :)  for allowing me to republish the mod and for allowing me to build upon his good work.
===============
Mod Use:
===============
This mod remains a community resource, use as you see fit.</thetext>

Word of a newly discovered area has spread through the wasteland from the dying lips of a lone wanderer who warned of giant monsters roaming an area of toxic wastes. His dying words warned others to stay away from the place unless they are very strong or have a lot of friends with them. 
You go to investigate only to find signs of a previous party having recently passed through and, following in their wake you begin to piece together both the story of who these people are and something of how the creatures of the place came to be as they were, eventually leading to a battle with the \&quot;Boss\&quot; of the area.
Installation: Download and extract the Valley of the Giants v1_0 main files into the data directory and answer yes to any overwrite requests, then do the same with any updated ESMs I may upload that you want.
Note: Though this version is effectively a \&quot;final\&quot; version, due to some of the bugginess of fallout new vegas (and its geck which was wanting to constantly crash on me unlike the FO3 version for some reason) and the always present possibility that I may have overlooked something, I will try to address any bugs anyone may run into with this mod as I far am I\&apos;m able, though if I am unable to reproduce said problem on my PC then such aid may be limited.</thetext>

The ESP of a &quot;supposed to be resource&quot; texture pack. This ESP adds ghouls that are related to that pack into the game, so they will spawn and such. Says it is incompatible with other mods that tweak the spawning system, most surely &quot;Monster Mod&quot; and so on.</thetext>

Warning - Adults only! This is an expansion/enhancement of the FNV Sexual Innuendo mod.
Requires [url=http://nvse.silverlock.org]NVSE![/url]
Requires [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36659]FNV Sexual Innuendo![/url]
Recommended: [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43773]Humping the Mojave[/url]
Current Features:
*Dynamic Alignment (Fix)
*Dynamic Duration
*Dynamic Position Change
*Dynamic Sex Stop
Dynamic Alignment (Fix)
-------------
Based on my SI Alignment Fix mod, this feature helps resolve alignment problems when having sex on beds.  Should you have sex on a bed and your bits don\&apos;t match up with your partner\&apos;s bits, use this feature.  Open the wsex Settings book in your inventory (from Sexual Innuendo). There is a new section called Alignment Fix. This will allow you to set a vertical offset - it will cause your partner to be positioned higher (positive values) or lower (negative) during bed sex.  10 is a good number to start with.  I keep mine on 8.
Dynamic Duration
----------------
Sex is no longer based on a static time limit.  The duration is now determined by your Action Points.  As you have sex, your AP will drop. When you run out, sex will end.  The more AP you have, the longer you will last!
Dynamic Position Change
-----------------------
Tired of being stuck with one or two random positions for the entire scene? Well, now you can change positions at will! Simply press the Attack button (default = Left mouse button), and you will instantly change positions! You can change as often as you want, as long as you\&apos;re having sex!
Dynamic Sex Stop
----------------
With the new Dynamic Duration, sex can potentially last quite awhile. But, now you can stop at any time, just by pressing the Block button (default = Right mouse button).
Features planned for next version:
---------------------------------
*Dynamic Frequency - The number of times you can have sex daily will be based on your total sex level. As you get more experienced, you can fornicate more frequently.
*Dynamic Success - How successful you are in your sexual encounters will no longer be random; it will be based on several factors, including: duration of intercourse, total sex level, a bit of luck and a bit of chance.
*FIX: Attempt to fix the disappearing player problem
Thanks!

Warning - Adults only! This is an expansion/enhancement of the FNV Sexual Innuendo mod.
Requires [url=http://nvse.silverlock.org]NVSE![/url]
Requires [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36659]FNV Sexual Innuendo![/url]
Recommended: [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43773]Humping the Mojave[/url]
Note: It is *highly* recommended to use NVSE Camera Mode 2 for sex scenes (set with the wsex Settings book in your inventory).
Current Features:
*Dynamic Alignment (SI Fix)
*Dynamic Duration
*Dynamic Position Change (UPDATED!)
*Dynamic Sex Stop
*Dynamic Working Camera (SI Fix) (NEW!)
Dynamic Alignment (Fix)
-------------
Based on my SI Alignment Fix mod, this feature helps resolve alignment problems (original Sexual Innuendo) when having sex on beds.  Should you have sex on a bed and your bits don\&apos;t match up with your partner\&apos;s bits, use this feature.  Open the wsex Settings book in your inventory (from Sexual Innuendo). There is a new section called Alignment Fix. This will allow you to set a vertical offset - it will cause your partner to be positioned higher (positive values) or lower (negative) during bed sex.  10 is a good number to start with.  I keep mine on 8.
Dynamic Duration
----------------
Sex is no longer based on a static time limit.  The duration is now determined by your Action Points.  As you have sex, your AP will drop. When you run out, sex will end.  The more AP you have, the longer you will last! Note: This only applies to sex involving the player. NPC-only sex will use the time set in the wsex Settings book.
Dynamic Position Change
-----------------------
Tired of being stuck with one or two random positions for the entire scene? Well, now you can change positions at will! Simply press the Attack button (default = Left mouse button), and you will instantly change positions! You can change as often as you want, but some AP is drained each time you change positions, so the more frequently you change positions, the shorter your sex will be.  Only applies to sex involving the player.
Dynamic Sex Stop
----------------
With the new Dynamic Duration, sex can potentially last quite awhile. But, now you can stop at any time, just by pressing the Block button (default = Right mouse button). Only applies to sex involving the player.
*Dynamic Working Camera (SI Fix)
--------------------------------
NVSE Camera Mode 2 is the best camera mode for viewing sex scenes. It allows you to move the camera anywhere for the best angles. Unfortunately, this mode had serious problems in the original Sexual Innuendo mod. Mainly, it frequently caused your character to disappear during sex, leaving your partner humping the air.  I have fixed this problem.  It was a bitch to do, actually.  Nearly a dozen scripts had to be created or extensively modified to get this working correctly. It should now work automatically 95% of the time. The bug might still occur in cramped spaces.  Should your character disappear during sex, I have also included a manual fix: Simply hold Mouse Button 3 (thumb button), move the mouse until you can see your character, release the button, and that should fix it. Alternatively, if you don\&apos;t have a thumb button, you can also press the Left Ctrl button.
Features planned for next version:
---------------------------------
*Dynamic Frequency - The number of times you can have sex daily will be based on your total sex level. As you get more experienced, you can fornicate more frequently.
*Dynamic Success - How successful you are in your sexual encounters will no longer be random; it will be based on several factors, including: duration of intercourse, total sex level, a bit of luck and a bit of chance. Your partner\&apos;s satisfaction might differ from yours, and they will get their own temporary buffs if the sex was good for them.
*Dynamic Cures - STD\&apos;s can be cured from non-vanilla companions
*Dynamic Voyeurism - Non-vanilla companions will be able to have sex with each other

[b]Now with Hardcore Mode[/b] see change log below for details.
Useable Toilets, Urinals, and Bathtubs - with sound fx
V.5
This archive contains 2 esp files
       UseableToilets.esp
   UseableToiletsUninstall.esp
Only use the first one if you are installing the mod, the second esp is for uninstalling and replacing toilets disabled by the first.
This mod requires the latest version of NVSE
You can download NVSE here http://nvse.silverlock.org/
----------
Important
----------
Please reset hardcore mode using the Toilet Paper item by turning it off, then back on. This will help prevent problems as some of the timers used in the mod have changed. 
------------
Description   New Hardcore mode added, see change log below for details!
------------
This mod adds an inventory item called Toilet Paper to the aid section of the pip boy. When you enter a new cell, or find a fixture that you want to replace click the Toilet Paper and select the desired option. If you are replacing toilets in your own home, or somewhere you wouldn\&apos;t expect to find random NPCs using the toilets, select the add toilets to my home option.
Sit on toilets will play a flushing sound when you or an NPC get up from them and walk away.
Urinals will play an unzip sound, peeing sound, and zip sound when used. To use a urinal simply walk up to it very close. Urinals are only for male characters, sorry ladies.
Tubs can sit two people. They will unequip your clothing, if you are wearing any, and play enter and leave splashing sounds. Upon leaving your clothing will be re-equipped. Placeable tubs will only do the above for the player due to some placement limitations. Replaced tube will do the above for the player and one companion, if two companions are in the tub only the first one entering will be affected.
If you decide you don\&apos;t want the placeable tub anymore open console, click it to show its id at the top of the screen and type, disable followed by the enter key, then MarkForDelete followed by the enter key. Repeat the process for the water mesh.
Companions with a sit option can use toilets. 
------
Notes
-----
Why create this mod when at least one other mod with sit on toilets exists? When I came across these meshes I thought it was a good idea. Who wants to drink from a dirty toilet anyway? The mods I saw were replacer mods where the mod authors went in and hand replaced the old toilets with the sit on type. That can cause conflicts with other mods that change cells obviously, plus it doesn\&apos;t affect newly created cells from other mods.
After the initial release for FO3 I included usable urinals, and bathtubs. Even added placeable bathtubs that you can purchase from the merchant in the GoodSprings General Store. The items are called Dirty Tub, Clean Tub, and Cleanest Tub, and sell for 300, 600, and 1000 caps respectively. Tubs weigh 50lbs to add some realism (yes I know a cast iron tub like this would actually be a few hundred pounds).
To place a purchased tub Drop the item from the misc scetion of your inventory. The tub can then be placed using the z key. Once in position enter sneak mode and activate the tub to set yout new useable two person tub.
Tubs, the placeable kind and the replacements for existing tubs are scaled up a bit (to avoid some clipping, feet still stick through the bottom, sorry best I can do) so keep this in mind when placing them.
My approach, while a little more combersome, allows for greater compatability along with support for other mods.
--------
Warning
--------  
This mod will disable existing toilets and tubs and replace them with the useable variety. Uninstalling this mod will leave you with an empty spot where they used to be. Be sure to activate the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp to replace those toilets, and leave it installed until you are sure all have been re-enabled.
-----------
Change Log
-----------
8-26-12: Changed the timers concerning the pee time variable. The new timer gives 12 hpurs before any warnings, then an additional warning each 3 hours. At the 21 hour mark an accident will happen if you do not find a toilet or use the No Pee chem. Be sure to reset hardcore mode using the Toilet Paper item to ensure the new timers are activated properly.
Added out houses as useable toilets. They function just like other toilets from this mod, but do not use the flushing sound. These out houses just have a script attached to the base object, so no need to run the Toilet Paper replacer function, they should work when activated.
Also added the Ultra Lux toilets to the replacer script, as it was pointed out I missed them in previous versions.
Lastly I added the ability to bathe in bodies of water, providing you have some Abraxo cleaner. To bathe in water bring up the pipboy and find the Toilet Paper aid item. Hole the zoom button (which should inform you that you can not drop quest items) And left click the Toilet Paper while still holding zoom. If you are in the water your armor should be removed, and the script will run just like in a bath tub cleaning the dirt over time. Only natural water bodies will work, not placeable water.
Previous update: Two new items are added to the camp fire menu
No-Pee
No-Poo
Each of these items will extend the time until your next bathroom visit. When using them your timer will be reset, but agailty penalty will remain until you find and use a toilet. Currently each recipe requires a dirty water, and either Broc Flower (for pee) or xander root (for poo).
5-22-12: Added an option to bind a hot key (of your selection) to display your current bathroom timers and mod penalties. Only available in hardcore mode obviously. If you elect not to bind a key, or later wish to change the key you selected, just restart hardcore mode.
5-14-12: Small change to the toilet script to prevent ladies from getting stuck while going No1. Previously pressing a directional control caused the script to halt leaving the player in a restrained state. Changed it to disable player controls while the sound is playing to avoid the issue. You will still not be able to get up until the sound stops, or a couple seconds after.
5-10-12: Fixed a couple script errors I found. Namely the dirt variable tracking, and the start/stop hardcore option. Should both work right now. Also found an interesting bug where the cha variable gats stored as -0.00, you can see this in the show stats option after you have restored charisma previously damaged from dirt. The game throws out this negative zero, then doesn\&apos;t know quite how to deal with it. I was able to get around the issue, but I find it interesting so I thought would mention it. 
5-9-12: Two new items, Fancy Shampoo, and Bath Beads. Both are sold by Old Lady Gibson, and the Street Vendor on the the Vegas Strip. When sold out they will restock in 7 game days. Having these items in your inventory while bathing will grant the Fresh Scent bouns, which boosts Charisma by 1 for 6 or 12 hours depending on if you have one or both items.
Fixed a bug where toilet sounds still played when pressing fire button even after getting up from the toilet.
Added splash sound when pressing the fire button while in tubs.
5-06-12: New Hardcore mode added.Not dependent on Hardcore mode selection in the game. Default is turned on, but you can turn it off in the toilet paper options menu if you prefer.
Players will have to use toilets, and tubs based on a time scale.
Peeing will need to be done once every 9 hours to avoid having an accident. At the 6 hour mark a message will be displayed \&quot;you need to pee 1\&quot;, and your agility will be decreased by 1. At 7 hours a message saying \&quot;you need to pee 2\&quot;, accompanied by another loss of 1 agility. * hour mark \&quot;you need to pee 3\&quot; agility -1. This is a total agility loss of 3 at this point. At the 9 hour mark a message saying \&quot;you wet yourself\&quot; will be displayed. At that point agility will return to normal, and your charisma will drop by .2 Peeing anytime before you wet yourself will reset agility, if any is lost, and reset the timer
Potty will have to be done once every 33 hours to avoid having an accident. Potty is treated the same as pee accept the times are 24, 27, 30, and 33. Each is accompanied by the -1 agility with the 33 mark restoring agility and decreasing charisma by 1.
Bathing will need to be done once a day to avoid a loss in character Charisma.It is handled on the same time scale as potty where 24 hours you get your first message that you need to bathe. Then every 3 hours you will get the message again. The first message results in a chariama drop of 1, and each following message at the 3 hour intervals results in an additional .2 loss to charisma. 
The dirt variable is used to track your total charisma loss due to having accidents, and not bathing. every point of dirt is equal to -.2 charisma.
Bathing is the only way to remove dirt and restore your charisma. While bathing you will restore .2 charisma every second you are in the tub. When dirt has been completely removed you will get a message box saying you are clean.
There are two items you will need to have in your inventory to use the toilets and tubs efficently. One is lottery tickets (for toilet paper) the other is abraxo cleaner (for tub bathing). Both of these items have been added to varions merchants throughout New Vegas and they will restock a few seconds after they run out. A full box of cleaner will remove about 60 dirt, and one lotto ticket will be used when using the toilets. Male characters only consume TP when going potty.
The menu has changed to add a few new options, and consolidate the old options. New is show status which will display the time you have to pee, potty, and bathe. It also displays your total dirt, charisma and agility penalties. There is also an option to turn off/restart the needs part of the mod. When turning off the feature your agility and charisma should be restored if they were lowered.
Sleeping will suspend your timers, so you shouldn\&apos;t get any dirtier or have any accidents while sleeping.
Waiting or fast travel on the other hand won\&apos;t suspend the timers, so plan accordingly.
When players select to potty on a toilet they will need to press the attack/fire button at least once while seated. Failure to do so will result in the player not registering as having pottied. So don\&apos;t be shy, fire away!
When the mod is first loaded it may take 2 to 3 minutes for some merchants to get their supply of lottery tickets and abraxo cleaner. Not every merchant will stock these items but I will tell you that chett at the good springs general store does. He is at the very bottom of the list though so it will take multiple iterations of the quest script for him to receive his supply. 
All of this is subject to change at any time.
4-29-12: Removed TribalPack.esm dependency

Installation
-------------
Extract the contents of this archive to the Fallout NV folder. Select the UseableToilets.esp in the data files section, and launch the game.
-------------
unistalling
-------------
Deselect the UseableToilets.esp and select the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp in the data files section. Keep the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp checked until all toilets have been replaced. If after that you find missing toilets just recheck the UseableToiletsUninstall.esp and re-enter the cell where you noticed them missing. The cell will have to load so you may need to change cells then come back.
Some of the static items are replaced as soon as this esp is activated, so place it as low as possible in the load order the first time it is run. After that you can move it higher if you need to.</thetext>

Ammo Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New basic ammo types are as follows:
Incendiary: Creates an incendiary explosion on impact, and sets targets on fire.

High Explosive: Creates an explosion on impact, Does massive damage and penetrates armour. Also great for seeing where your shot lands.
Tracer: Shows you the path of your bullet, in all guns! Most machine guns also only fire 50% tracers, So these fire 100%. See how accurate your pistol or rifle is.
Plastic: Less lethal rounds, Mainly do fatigue damage.
SWC +P: Like normal rounds, Only heavier, And packed with an overpressure powder load. More damage, Small DT reduction. Small weapon condition penalty.
+P: Like normal rounds, but packed with an overpressure powder load. Slightly more damage, small DT reduction, Small weapon condition penalty.

Incinerator ammo:
Fire: Standard flame explosion
Plasma: More intense flame damage

Modulated: Modulated to produce a longer, lower energy output that does large damage to flesh, but fails to damage armoured foes.
Pulsed: Micro pulsed output that is much better at defeating armour, Without the wear that overcharged ammo results in.
New 12Ga/20Ga/25mm/40mm ammo is as follows:
Buckshot: Wide spread, High damage.
Magnum: More buckshot, More powder, More damage.

Restructuring of the leveled lists was done to more easily add weapons to factions, and know exactly where and what level they will show up, Resulting in a much cleaner and easier to edit selection of leveled lists, as well as easier to make mods inter-compatible, and easier to copy and paste additions from one faction/npc subtype to another in FNVedit, resulting in much less work overall to add a weapon to multiple leveled lists.
Rebalances most vendors to have much more ammo, and more relevant weapons and mods.
Rebalances most NPC&apos;s to spawn with more variation in weaponry. Many NPC&apos;s used to be hard coded to only use one weapon.
See included Leveled List Organizer.txt for more details and instructions on how to make your own LLO patches!

FAQ:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Is it Compatible with X?
A: CASE.esm adds totally new ammo and alters nothing, however to use that ammo, CASE-Rebalance.esp alters a number of form lists.
As such, CASE will likely not be compatible with other mods that add ammo without a merged patch. However it should be compatible with most other mods, Although mods that add weapons to NPC&apos;s typically won&apos;t spawn with the new CASE ammo, unless a dedicated patch has been made.
Currently, Classic Fallout Weapons has its own patch. Project Nevada has been tested by a user and no major conflicts found
If you find a conflict between this mod and another, Please leave a comment and I may attempt to fix it.
Leveled List Organizer alters a large number of leveled lists and will likely override other mods changes. It will work with other mods, but likely prevent them from adding items to NPCs unless a proper patch is made for that mod.
Q: Can I use CASE ammo in weapons another mod adds?
A: Yes!
Q: If I don&apos;t install &apos;Leveled List Organizer&apos;, How do I get the new CASE ammo?
A: Install craft pack and you will be able to craft it all from items already in the game.
Q: Is it Compatible with DLC?
A: Honest hearts has a patch to make it compatible and use the new .45 Auto ammo types. However I don&apos;t have GRA or Lonesome road yet, so I can not make patches for those DLC&apos;s. It should work fine with Dead Money and Old World Blues. Although new NPC&apos;s might not spawn with the new CASE ammo.
Q: I don&apos;t like ammo type X, Can you remove it?
A: No, However I have been considering making a &apos;Realistic&apos; version of the LLO-Partial Patch-CASE.esp plug-in, that would result in NPC&apos;s and vendors not having the more exotic ammo types. (Although craft pack could still be used to craft them), If you desire this, please leave a comment and tell me what ammo types you don&apos;t like.
Q: I found a bug
A: Please report it in the comments section, or as a private message to me. I love to get bug reports as finding a bug is most of the work needed to fix one. Even if it is something minor like a typo.
Q: The game stutters or lags when I use explosive ammo?
A: Explosion Stutter Fix, Highly recommended for less stutter

This mod will install a strap-on tool.
After installation, look in the sink in the ladies room in the Prospector Saloon.
Also a shopkeeper with a prediliction for vault gear will have them for sale.
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
FOMM Users: Add Package should handle everything, in the usual fashion.
NON-FOMM Users, or those who don\&apos;t trust my file layouts
Use 7-zip to extract the contents of this zip, then merge the DATA folder and sub-folders into your FNV Data folder.
(This should result in the meshes and textures being in the right places)
Copy the mesh to (this part may vary)\\SteamApps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\armor\\Rebel strap-on\\
Copy the textures to (this part may vary)\\SteamApps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\textures\\armor\\rebel strapon\\
copy the esp to (this part may vary)\\SteamApps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\
Activate the RebelStraponPort.esp in FOMM or whatever tool you use to manage plug-ins.
Load a game, Obtain new toy.  Play with it.
Possible bugs:
If you are at Vault 21 you may have to stay away for 3 game-days so that the vendor inventory respawns.
This looks ok on type3 slim, but there may be some clipping of the \&apos;belt\&apos; on other body meshes.  There is not much I can do about this.
The dreaded RED ! of missing meshes or ugly stuff from missing textures.  Double check against the directory structure inside the zip file.
UNINSTALL:
FOMM Users: Use package uninstall.
Non-FOMM Users: \&apos;uncheck\&apos; the esp from you launcher.  Load a game, (ignore missing add-on message), do a proper Save (NOT a Quick Save, somewhere OTHER THAN the Prospector Saloon and Vault 21.)
Exit Game
Delete the esp, mesh and textures you installed for this mod.

If you like this mod, PLEASE endorse it!
Version: 1.4
THIS MOD REQUIES NVSE! The ACR will not work properly if it is not installed.
[url=\&quot;http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39981\&quot;]CaliberX[/url] is highly recommended for this mod. Version 1.4 and onward includes a non-CaliberX version as well.
Description:
************
This mod will add some new weapons to the game\&apos;s leveled lists and vendor lists. 
The weapons added are (as of this version):
ACR 10.5\&quot; Carbine - Uses 5mm ammo, similar to the assault carbine
ACR 14.5\&quot; Battle Rifle - Uses 5.56mm ammo, similar to the marksman carbine.
ACR 18\&quot; Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR) - Uses .308 rounds, similar to the sniper rifle.
ACR LMG: Light Machine Gun variant, holds 100 5mm rounds but much less accurate.
MP5K - Uses 9mm ammo.
MP5/10 - Uses 10mm ammo.
MP5/10SD - Silenced version of the MP5
SVD - Uses .308 ammo, 10 rounds
AS Val - Uses the CaliberX 9x39 ammo (556 for non CaliberX version), 20 rounds, full auto
VSS - Uses the CaliberX 9x39 ammo (556 for non CaliberX version), 10 rounds, semi auto
Included is an armory featuring all these weapons plus some useful higher level vanilla weapons. It is accessable through the small ZL Armaments storefront located in southwest Vegas along the I-15. You\&apos;ll need a key (or a 100 level lockpick skill) to access it. You can get the key if you have any safehouse key in your inventory. Alternitavely if you don\&apos;t mind cheating you can add it through the console (xx004049, the xx\&apos;s correspond to the load order number). It can be used as a faction-neutral safehouse if you wish as well with plenty of storage space, a bed, a reloading bench, and a work bench.
If you head to the 188 Trading Post you\&apos;ll find a new merchant set up shop there. Since the original ZL Armaments Store was overrun by fiends and lost (he doesn\&apos;t have the key) he decided to set up shop there instead. There\&apos;s plenty of 9x39mm ammo there if you have a hard time finding any, but it isn\&apos;t too cheap either. By level 12 you should have access to all of the weapons in this mod through him.
Installation:
*************
1. Unzip all files to c:\\Program Files\\Bethesda Softworks\\Fallout New Vegas\\Data (or wherever your Data folder is located)
2. Open up Fallout Mod Manager and activate ZL-Armaments.esp.
3. Play the game!
Uninstallation:
***************
Delete \&quot;ZL-Armaments.esp\&quot; from the Data folder.
Delete the ZLWeapons &amp; ZLAttachments from the Textures\\Weapons directory &amp; the ZL Stuff folder under Meshes\\Clutter.
Delete the ZLWeapons from the Meshes\\Weapons directory &amp; the ZL Stuff folder under Meshes\\Clutter.
Delete the folder \&quot;ZLWeapons\&quot; under the Sounds\\fx\\wpn directory.
History:
********
V1.4:	Fixed ACOG issue and texture errors on ACR
	Added non-CaliberX version
V1.3:	Added a new merchant to the 188 Trading Post
	Fixed many bugs
	Fixed the MP5 Ironsights
	Increased damage, accuracy, and rate of fire on the ACR 10.5\&quot; Carbine
	Increased damage but decreased magazine size on the ACR 18\&quot; DMR
	ACOG attachment for ACR now uses an actual scope instead of the mildot overlay.
V 1.2:CaliberX is now required for this mod for the 9x39 ammo.
	Fixed some errors in the ACR script that wouldn\&apos;t add back the 18\&quot; Barrel Kit.
	All old 9x39 ammo will be automatically swapped with the new ammo via script.
V 1.1:Fixed the incorrect file pathing for the posters causing a missing mesh error.
	Fixed the rotation of a highway kit piece outside of the store
	Zero\&apos;d in all ironsights for weapons, they all should be more accurate now. The MP5s iron sights aren\&apos;t very pretty now however.
V 1.0:Initial Release
Possible Issues:
****************
The ejector port and trigger on the VSS and AS Val don\&apos;t animate as of now due to major displacement issues that occured when they were animated. You can hardly tell anyway.
This mod shouldn\&apos;t conflict with anything that I know of.  If it does, please let me know.  The texture is also a bit high res, but it should run fine on most computers.  As for the leveled lists, they are added to the vanilla lists by a script so there should be no conflicts with any other mods.
If you find any other issues with this mod please let me know and I\&apos;ll do my best to get them fixed in a timely manner.
Licensing/Legal:
****************
Feel free to use this mod however you wish, just ask me before using any of my work. Most likely I\&apos;ll be happy to allow you to use whatever you may need.  Be sure to give me credit where credit is due, and do not upload this mod to any other sites.  These files are not intended for commercial use and should not be used as such.

Installation:
STEP 1. Download and install each part in numerical order. Copy and paste data folder from each part into your Fallout New Vegas directory.
***IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL IN NUMERICAL ORDER, YOU WILL BE MISSING STATIONS!!!***
* As this mod is updated you will only need to download the sequential part. For example, if you installed parts 1 thru 4 before, and come back to see there are updates titled &quot;part 5, part 6, part 7,&quot; again you want to INSTALL EACH ONE IN NUMERICAL ORDER!
STEP 2. Check &quot;OldWorldRadio.esp&quot; in the Data Files menu of the New Vegas launcher or your launcher/mod manager of choice.
Uninstall:
Just uncheck OldWorldRadio.esp in your game launcher, delete the file in the Data folder, then go inside Sound&gt;Voice and delete the OldWorldRadio.esp folder.
Compatibility:
This should be compatible with all radio and other mods out there. The talking activators required to broadcast the stations are placed inside the Goodsprings Gas Station, where they are out of sight. Mods that make significant changes to that area might be affected. If you run into any issues please leave feedback so we can fix the problem.
At this time the radio stations won&apos;t be available in any of the DLC areas. We are looking to make them available in the near future.</thetext>

If you download this mod check in every day or two (or three) for an update(however i am taking a break from this mod)
this mod requires honest hearts
to get to these islands find the teleporter in the devil\&apos;s gullet.
use this mod like a resource i guess, i am still working on it, but incase i don\&apos;t finish people can use it for their own mods. i will still keep working on it as much as i can though.
okay here\&apos;s what i\&apos;m planning; a small cluster of islands near north africa, home to a few people, they ask you to check on a hunter a couple islands over who has been gone for a few days, you get there and he is gone, there is blood everywhere, when you go back to tell them, everyone is dead and you fight adjule (mythical demon dog living in north africa) when its almost dead it dissapears, and you hunt it through all the islands and stuff.
and here\&apos;s what i got now; you find a small island and some raiders, you hunt around and find some weapons then battle adjule, (save first), you are then transported to... (see the images that are all red?, there) and it ends there. 
hope you like what there is so far. 
if you want you can use this, just give me credit for what i did
oh yeah, heres a list of the weapons
-burst rifle
-scoped burst rifle
-tactical assault rifle
-scoped tactical assault rifle
-battle axe
-holo-shotgun
-holo-assault rifle
-great white
-dart gun
-version 0.2.5-
added holo-rifle
added custom location system(beta)
balanced combat
now when youkill adjule you get a key to the diner and you are returned to the island upon killing thr ghoul overlord
-version 0.2.7-
fixed floating tree
added birds 
added fish
added other various effects
-version 0.2.9-
i need some help, i am adding a weapon(the tactical Pistol), and whn it is equipped a message pops up asking if you want it to be burst or semi-auto. (burst is option 0, semi auto is 1) but the weapon never fires burst, no matter what i pick. have a look at the script and see if you can fix it, you will be credited.
balanced holo-weapons
added temporary and experimental (/not working) tactical istol
added my fist npc
fixed fish swimming above water
-version 0.3.5-
added more great wites
added (unfinished) diner
added npcs
fixed the allways midnight glitch
expande storyline (now go to the camp then the adjule apears, hen you attack it, i dissapears and kills evryone on the island, then you fight it)</thetext>

To get there in game, go just south of Camp Golf and you will find a boat next to a small pier, and that should take you there.
THE TORN CITY. Upon arriving at the Torn City, you find a group of survivors, desperatley clinging on to what is left of their lives. Facing constant threat from everything else that lives in the city, you are their last hope for survival. Prepare to face menacing creatures, rutheless mutants, and the unforgiving elements of the city. 
REQUIREMENTS:
All of the main DLCs (Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road)
I tried to iron out all the bugs and problems, but if there ares till any, please leave a message in the comments section! =)

October 29th, 2012: I am still working on the next update! Please be patient. I am one guy working on a very large mod with a very busy life. I try to find time to work on it when I can, but that still isn\&apos;t much. It will still probably be a couple of months, but long winter days are coming up and I should be able to find more time to work on it!

Adds and removes several perks that have uncontrollable features like bloody mess or lightstep (yes, you can do it using console... a matter of convenience - nothing more). Also has ability to show skills higher than 100 (see second screenshot).
REQUIERS the mod configuration menu by Pelinor. Without it toggler will not know what to do, so it will do nothing. )
So go get it! http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42507
Shouldn&apos;t have any compatibility problems.</thetext>

I appreciate the all feedback, but once again, let me remind everyone that this isn\&apos;t my work.  I am sharing a mod that I found to be appealing, in hopes that others might find use of it.  In response to some questions.  
If you are getting the black underwear texture issue, make sure you have already installed a Type 3 compatible body texture.   If you have not, download the \&quot;Body Replacer and Textures\&quot; file that I have uploaded, and make sure that is installed.  
Next- Can I remove the pubic hair.    Yes I can, no I won\&apos;t, I don\&apos;t need to, simple as that.  This body type is compatible with ALL Type 3 textures.  I find the Pubic hair to be a decent enough touch, but if you do not like it, simply find a body texture replacer that does NOT have pubic hair and overwrite.  
Some textures can be found here- http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34702
Had some requests for IDs for armors so here they are.  When typing it in, remember \&quot;xx\&quot; is the load number for the specific mod, so if the Lingerie Mod is \&quot;3D\&quot; then the white bikini will be \&quot;3D000ea7\&quot;.

This character is not my character, I simply used the images the creator used when he/she created the mod-sort of a tribute to their work.  I do not know what race they used, or what custom face textures they are using.  There are however plenty of good female face textures on the nexus, as well as a diverse group of race mods.  
You should only need the skeleton for BnB, but if you want actual bouncing, you will need to download the proper animations.
If the fishnet texture is not showing up properly, as if its coated onto the body and deformed, re-download the mod, you are using an outdated version.
I uploaded this file here not only to share with others, but in hopes that we might start seeing new outfits meshed to the T3F body type.  If you have created something, feel free to share it with the community, the files are open for anyone to use.  
Also, there ARE vanilla outfit replacers for the T3F body, but only for Fo3.  Porting would be a simple matter, however, I don\&apos;t really play New Vegas, and I have been wrapped up with a few games.... (Starcraft 2, Men of War, World of Tanks, S4 League, Mass Effect Trilogy, Blade and Soul(Private server) and Warhammer:space marine).  The replacers can be found here
http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=14359 should anyone be interested.
Oh, and upload images!!! :D
First off, this mod is NOT my creation, ALL credit goes to the original author-and those he gave credit to, the location I obtained this mod, no longer supports the download of these, but in the readmes of the original files, the author gave permission to freely distribute. Unfortunately, I do not have access to the name of the original author, as the files are no longer accessible.
This mod contains a custom texture set for the Type 3 F body replacer by Exeter.
UPDATE: Re-uploaded the Lingerie, Fishnet and Nurse outfits re-meshed for BB(Bouncing Breasts).  In order to take advantage of this you need a compatible skeleton, such as the one found here http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=45229
This also contains 4 sets of clothes and armors.
They are as follows:
Lingerie set
Body Fishnet
Black Puppet Armor re-mesh
Hyper Nurse Victory Yuno for T3f
The lingerie, Fishnet and Black Puppet armor will all be added directly to your inventory upon game startup.
Credit given to all the modders the original author gave to.
Dimon99 for Type3 replacer
Exeter for Type3F replacer
Backsteppo for altered T3 shoulder mesh
Hentai for Hentai Dark Rose Armor(Oblivion)
Jimsonzgl for the Black Puppet Armor(Oblivion)
Bronson for the Dark Temptress(Type3)</thetext>

IMPORTANT NOTE: The old .esp is now an Esm. This esm will be required for all further updates or add-ons. If there is something I can not fix, you are welcome to release an add-on esp for this project. Do not use the Esm in conjuction with the old .esps. Use one or the other.
Have you ever thought that the Lonesome Road was a bit too short? I have. And so I have created this. The Lonesome Road Expansion Project will expand the Divide, and give you an extra hour of playtime.
As of now, 13 new interiors have been added.
-Crytek Medicinal Basement (Just before the Cave of the Abaddon)
-Ruined NCR Mine Shack (Inside Rawr\&apos;s Den)
-NCR Mine (Inside Rawr\&apos;s Den)
-Manager\&apos;s Apartment (To the right of Ulysses\&apos; Temple)
-Hopeville Supply (Next to the Marked Men Guard Outpost)
-Survivor\&apos;s Bunker (Right behind Hudson Steel)
-Hudson Steel (In Hopeville, past the Marked Men Guard Outpost)
-Prophet\&apos;s Shack (Just outside the Canyon Wreckage, by Primm. Unmarked location)
-Hopeville Men\&apos;s Barracks B
-Hopeville Officer Barracks
-Hopeville Women\&apos;s Barracks B
-Broken Dreams Cave (Underneath the High Road)
-Vault 24 (Beta version. Inside Broken Dreams Cave. Contains only the Living Quarters. Not even close to being finished. Released for suggestions)
New NPCs
-Prophet (Currently disabled until the scripting is completed)
-Private Samantha Williams
-NCR 2nd Recon Scout (Overlooking Hopeville, in the campsite just past the Canyon Wreckage)
-Dead survivors/prospectors
New enemies
-Baby Tunnelers
-Marked Men Elite Hunters
REQUIREMENTS:
-Lonesome Road
-Honest Hearts
Load Order: Load the Esm directly below the Lonesome Road. If you\&apos;re using the Esp version, you may load the esp anywhere.
Legal/Permissions: You may use this mod however you wish, or release add-ons, but proper credit must be given to me. If you find any significant bugs, or have a suggestion, please leave a comment in the Comments tab.
Known Bugs/Issues:
-I\&apos;m afraid Honest Hearts is now a required file. I used an asset from Honest Hearts by mistake. Removing its use would require significant rewrite of the mod.
-Some of the dead NPCs may spawn floating in the air. Has been fixed in the Esm version.
-A few overlap problems here and there. It\&apos;s only noticable in one area, however.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The old .esp is now an Esm. This esm will be required for all further updates or add-ons. If there is something I can not fix, you are welcome to release an add-on esp for this project. Do not use the Esm in conjuction with the old .esps. Use one or the other.
Have you ever thought that the Lonesome Road was a bit too short? I have. And so I have created this. The Lonesome Road Expansion Project will expand the Divide, and give you an extra hour of playtime.
As of now, 13 new interiors have been added.
-Crytek Medicinal Basement (Just before the Cave of the Abaddon)
-Ruined NCR Mine Shack (Inside Rawr\&apos;s Den)
-NCR Mine (Inside Rawr\&apos;s Den)
-Manager\&apos;s Apartment (To the right of Ulysses\&apos; Temple)
-Hopeville Supply (Next to the Marked Men Guard Outpost)
-Survivor\&apos;s Bunker (Right behind Hudson Steel)
-Hudson Steel (In Hopeville, past the Marked Men Guard Outpost)
-Prophet\&apos;s Shack (Just outside the Canyon Wreckage, by Primm. Unmarked location)
-Hopeville Men\&apos;s Barracks B
-Hopeville Officer Barracks
-Hopeville Women\&apos;s Barracks B
-Broken Dreams Cave (Underneath the High Road)
-Vault 24 (Beta version. Inside Broken Dreams Cave. Contains only the Living Quarters. Not even close to being finished. Released for suggestions)
New NPCs
-Prophet (Currently disabled until the scripting is completed)
-Private Samantha Williams
-NCR 2nd Recon Scout (Overlooking Hopeville, in the campsite just past the Canyon Wreckage)
-Dead survivors/prospectors
New enemies
-Baby Tunnelers
-Marked Men Elite Hunters
REQUIREMENTS:
-Lonesome Road
-Honest Hearts
Load Order: Load the Esm directly below the Lonesome Road. If you\&apos;re using the Esp version, you may load the esp anywhere.
Legal/Permissions: You may use this mod however you wish, or release add-ons, but proper credit must be given to me. If you find any significant bugs, or have a suggestion, please leave a comment in the Comments tab.
Known Bugs/Issues:
-I\&apos;m afraid Honest Hearts is now a required file. I used an asset from Honest Hearts by mistake. Removing its use would require significant rewrite of the mod.
-Some of the dead NPCs may spawn floating in the air. Has been fixed in the Esm version.
-A few overlap problems here and there. It\&apos;s only noticable in one area, however.

===================[/color]
[color=yellow] ===================
          Description
===================[/color]
Ever thought that despite you\&apos;re living in one of the grandest, greatest relics of the old world - New Vegas, a crappy, rusty old boat in the uncivilized lands of the capital DC still has a luxury attire shop, whilst all vegas got is nothing, despite being full of gamblers, casino managers, personell, all in suits?
Well, this mod changes that by adding the counterpart of  bannons humble store in the DC to our very own Freeside.
The Atomic Attire is a small, albeit luxurious clothing store located in freeside, by the entrance to the strip, inside you will find every kind of suit in the game, we even have importing options (compability patches for other mods that adds new suits).

[b][size=6pt]3[/b][/size][size=4pt][center][b][color=#00BFFF]What NVEC Does
This mod is a ginormous Compilation of hundreds of different mods
All plugins are standalone meaning they don\&apos;t require each other to run unless using patches[/b][/center][/color][/size]
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete[/b] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one.[/color] This plugin is mostly a compilation of hundreds of different mods which massively reduces load orders, increases immersion, adds quests, restores uncut content, integrates new weapons/armors into the game properly, turns useless statics into containers/activators, and much more. Not only does it contain all of that, it also has my own tweaks and inclusions which are more map markers to unmarked locations, companions gear are all shown in inventories so you can fully customize your followers however you wish. Most mods merged into here have either been fixed, designed for NVEC users, changed to better suit FNV, and/or expanded to all DLCs. For the full list of inclusions, click links a little lower to make sure you don\&apos;t have a plugin running that\&apos;s already in this esm. I\&apos;ve gone through great detail and time putting this plugin together so I hope you enjoy it :)
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as Complete but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url]. The primary focus of NVCE is the alterations of NPCs, which range from cosmetic fixes, stat changes, inventory etc in order to comply with a strict principle of Fallout lore. The best way to think of this is as Fallout 3\&apos;s \&quot;Project Beauty\&quot; or the \&quot;New Vegas Redesigned\&quot;. Many of the issues addressed include terribly disproportional faces and wacky hair colouring (see pictures for more detail). Problems with faces clipping through masks or goggles for NPCs have also been addressed (ie. African American\&apos;s protruding lips cause clipping issues with Legion face masks). There are also problems with NPC inventories, and these have been addressed also. Although credit is where credits due; for most of the important named NPCs do happen to look reasonably created and far more distinctive than Fallout 3\&apos;s unique NPCs. However, there are still countless NPCs with unacceptable styles, such as bright hair, pale skin or just being plain ugly.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes[/color][/b] is a separated esm from Complete which just contains fixes to activators, ingestibles, ammunitions, armor, cells, classes, containers, creatures, dialogue topics, doors, object effects, factions, form lists, globals, head parts, lights, leveled items, messages, base effects, misc items, notes, npcs, packages, perks, projectiles, quests, recipes, scripts, sounds, actor effects, statics, terminals, texture sets, weapons, worldspaces, etc. They all are my fixes and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as NVEC BugFixes but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url].
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Enhancements[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that just contains enhancements and no bugfixes. Contains improvements, changes, expansions, tweaks, reduced annoyances, and basically making FNV badass and how it should have been in the 1st place. It\&apos;s my enhancements and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Reduce CTD[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that repairs [url=http://pastebin.com/X1Eakfup]errors/warnings[/url] in FNV and DLC ESMs reported by [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url]. This results in quests, loading worldspaces/cells, roaming the wastes, and basically running FNV in general with considerably less crashes. This plugin is how this mod all got started and where my skills mostly are.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Extras - MCM[/color][/b] is an optional plugin made separately towards the Mod Config Menu. It requires the Mod Config Menu and NVSE. It only contains the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39997]FPS Weapon Wheel[/url] at the moment. THIS PLUGIN IS STRICTLY FOR MCM MODS ONLY
[color=#FFD700][b]More Perks Merge[/color][/b] is a version of Dree\&apos;s More Perks combining all his esps/esms into one esm. Includes More Perks, More Traits, More Perks for Companions, and all his updates. The fomod installation is designed to output the NO DLC and DLC as the same name. Check lower for proper installation.

[color=#FFD700]NVEC Complete[/color] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one. 
If you want everything install NVEC Complete OR NVEC Complete + NVCE. This has everything NVEC has to offer and it\&apos;s made into one esm file instead of three separate plugins. 
If you decide that you do not want to install complete you can choose from which modules you want to install(Reduce CTD, BugFixes, and Enhancements).

[*]Check the \&quot;NVEC LOAD ORDER EXAMPLE\&quot; a little lower so you know what you want to get before downloading anything
[*]Check your load order Vs [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/EnhancementModInclusions.html]Enhancement Mod Inclusions List[/url] + [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/BugfixModInclusions.html]BugFix Mod Inclusions List[/url] so you don\&apos;t have a mod running that\&apos;s already included. Remove the esps/esms from the already included mods. Uninstalling the already included mods is recommended to save space.
[*]Download what you want from the download section (this should be obvious what to do by now)
[*]Each download is not made towards NMM or a fomod so I recommend to manually install NVEC by opening with [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7zip[/url] then drag and drop into your FNV Data Folder (Your computer skills scare me if you don\&apos;t know how to do this)

[color=#FFD700]How to start it[/color][/b][/size] - You have to find Randal\&apos;s shack with a note on it which is near the [url=http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Canyon_wreckage]Canyon Wreckage[/url]. Once you pickup the note, NVB1 will start and the door will unlock. In order to start NVB2, you have to complete NVB1.

[color=#FFD700]How to start it[/color][/b][/size] - At the Nipton Road Rest-Stop, South of Primm. There\&apos;s a manhole in the middle of the parking lot.
[size=3pt][b][color=#FFD700]Important[/color][/b][/size] - The laser barrier WILL kill followers that enter it. Please tell them to wait before doing so! I had to make a tough decision, but this is a no-follower quest mod. It allowed him FAR more freedom when it came to scripted cutscenes and story. There is no easy way to account for non-vanilla followers.

All plugins are standalone meaning they don\&apos;t require each other to run unless using patches[/b][/center][/color][/size]
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete[/b] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one.[/color] This plugin is mostly a compilation of hundreds of different mods which massively reduces load orders, increases immersion, adds quests, restores uncut content, integrates new weapons/armors into the game properly, turns useless statics into containers/activators, and much more. Not only does it contain all of that, it also has my own tweaks and inclusions which are more map markers to unmarked locations, companions gear are all shown in inventories so you can fully customize your followers however you wish. Most mods merged into here have either been fixed, designed for NVEC users, changed to better suit FNV, and/or expanded to all DLCs. For the full list of inclusions, click links a little lower to make sure you don\&apos;t have a plugin running that\&apos;s already in this esm. I\&apos;ve gone through great detail and time putting this plugin together so I hope you enjoy it :)
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as Complete but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url]. The primary focus of NVCE is the alterations of NPCs, which range from cosmetic fixes, stat changes, inventory etc in order to comply with a strict principle of Fallout lore. The best way to think of this is as Fallout 3\&apos;s \&quot;Project Beauty\&quot; or the \&quot;New Vegas Redesigned\&quot;. Many of the issues addressed include terribly disproportional faces and wacky hair colouring (see pictures for more detail). Problems with faces clipping through masks or goggles for NPCs have also been addressed (ie. African American\&apos;s protruding lips cause clipping issues with Legion face masks). There are also problems with NPC inventories, and these have been addressed also. Although credit is where credits due; for most of the important named NPCs do happen to look reasonably created and far more distinctive than Fallout 3\&apos;s unique NPCs. However, there are still countless NPCs with unacceptable styles, such as bright hair, pale skin or just being plain ugly.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes[/color][/b] is a separated esm from Complete which just contains fixes to activators, ingestibles, ammunitions, armor, cells, classes, containers, creatures, dialogue topics, doors, object effects, factions, form lists, globals, head parts, lights, leveled items, messages, base effects, misc items, notes, npcs, packages, perks, projectiles, quests, recipes, scripts, sounds, actor effects, statics, terminals, texture sets, weapons, worldspaces, etc. They all are my fixes and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as NVEC BugFixes but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url].
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Enhancements[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that just contains enhancements and no bugfixes. Contains improvements, changes, expansions, tweaks, reduced annoyances, and basically making FNV badass and how it should have been in the 1st place. It\&apos;s my enhancements and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Reduce CTD[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that repairs [url=http://pastebin.com/X1Eakfup]errors/warnings[/url] in FNV and DLC ESMs reported by [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url]. This results in quests, loading worldspaces/cells, roaming the wastes, and basically running FNV in general with considerably less crashes. This plugin is how this mod all got started and where my skills mostly are.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Extras - MCM[/color][/b] is an optional plugin made separately towards the Mod Config Menu. It requires the Mod Config Menu and NVSE. It only contains the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39997]FPS Weapon Wheel[/url] at the moment. THIS PLUGIN IS STRICTLY FOR MCM MODS ONLY
[color=#FFD700][b]More Perks Merge[/color][/b] is a version of Dree\&apos;s More Perks combining all his esps/esms into one esm. Includes More Perks, More Traits, More Perks for Companions, and all his updates. The fomod installation is designed to output the NO DLC and DLC as the same name. Check lower for proper installation.

Thank you for choosing NVEC :D
Installations are packaged into [url=http://www.7-zip.org]7zips[/url]. Any bugs you find with NVEC and the vanilla game please report them to the comments section. I keep track of all bugs reported by users so don\&apos;t be shy.

[*]NVEC Complete
[*]NVEC Complete + NVCE
[*]NVEC BugFixes
[*]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE
[*]NVEC Enhancements
[*]NVEC Reduce CTD
[/list]
[color=#FFD700]NVEC Complete[/color] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one. 
If you want everything install NVEC Complete OR NVEC Complete + NVCE. This has everything NVEC has to offer and it\&apos;s made into one esm file instead of three separate plugins. 
If you decide that you do not want to install complete you can choose from which modules you want to install(Reduce CTD, BugFixes, and Enhancements).

[list]
[*]Check the \&quot;NVEC LOAD ORDER EXAMPLE\&quot; a little lower so you know what you want to get before downloading anything
[*]Check your load order Vs [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/EnhancementModInclusions.html]Enhancement Mod Inclusions List[/url] + [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/BugfixModInclusions.html]BugFix Mod Inclusions List[/url] so you don\&apos;t have a mod running that\&apos;s already included. Remove the esps/esms from the already included mods. Uninstalling the already included mods is recommended to save space.
[*]Download what you want from the download section (this should be obvious what to do by now)
[*]Each download is not made towards NMM or a fomod so I recommend to manually install NVEC by opening with [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7zip[/url] then drag and drop into your FNV Data Folder (Your computer skills scare me if you don\&apos;t know how to do this)

[*]Then you will download the merged more perks esm from the NVEC optional downloads and use FOMM - Package manager, since it\&apos;s a fomod
[*]Then you will see the More Perks esm in your load order and make sure it\&apos;s checked before playing

[list]
[*]Place Extras esp and menus folder into your FNV data folder

You can enable the HUD element manually by the following steps:[/color][list]
[*]Go to your (installdir)\\Data\\Menus\\Main\\ folder.
[*]Open hud_main_menu.xml file in a text editor (notepad or notepad++ will do fine).
[*]Scroll to the very bottom of the file.

[list]
[*]When I scroll while zoomed out my weapons keep switching. Hold \&quot;F\&quot; to avoid that when zooming in and out
[*]If nothing happens when you scroll up and down then you haven\&apos;t activated it yet with the Unified Hud
[*]If you scroll up and down only hearing beeping sounds then change the minimum clip count to 0
[/list]
[color=#FFD700]Uninstall Weapon Wheel:[/color]
[list]
[*]Untick and/or remove the Extras esp
[*]Deactivate FPS Weapon Wheel in Unified Hud
[*]If you had your hotkeys on the mousewheel, be sure to go into 3rd person mode and save like that, before uninstalling.

[color=#FFD700]How to start it[/color][/b][/size] - You have to find Randal\&apos;s shack with a note on it which is near the [url=http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Canyon_wreckage]Canyon Wreckage[/url].

[size=3pt][b][color=#FFD700]Important[/color][/b][/size] - The laser barrier WILL kill followers that enter it. Please tell them to wait before doing so! I had to make a tough decision, but this is a no-follower quest mod. It allowed him FAR more freedom when it came to scripted cutscenes and story. There is no easy way to account for non-vanilla followers.

================================================================================================================================================
[b][size=6pt]3[/b][/size][size=4pt][center][b][color=#00BFFF]What NVEC Does
This mod is a ginormous Compilation of hundreds of different mods
All plugins are standalone meaning they don\&apos;t require each other to run unless using patches[/b][/center][/color][/size]
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete[/b] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one.[/color] This plugin is mostly a compilation of hundreds of different mods which massively reduces load orders, increases immersion, adds quests, restores uncut content, integrates new weapons/armors into the game properly, turns useless statics into containers/activators, and much more. Not only does it contain all of that, it also has my own tweaks and inclusions which are more map markers to unmarked locations, companions gear are all shown in inventories so you can fully customize your followers however you wish. Most mods merged into here have either been fixed, designed for NVEC users, changed to better suit FNV, and/or expanded to all DLCs. For the full list of inclusions, click links a little lower to make sure you don\&apos;t have a plugin running that\&apos;s already in this esm. I\&apos;ve gone through great detail and time putting this plugin together so I hope you enjoy it :)
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as Complete but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url]. The primary focus of NVCE is the alterations of NPCs, which range from cosmetic fixes, stat changes, inventory etc in order to comply with a strict principle of Fallout lore. The best way to think of this is as Fallout 3\&apos;s \&quot;Project Beauty\&quot; or the \&quot;New Vegas Redesigned\&quot;. Many of the issues addressed include terribly disproportional faces and wacky hair colouring (see pictures for more detail). Problems with faces clipping through masks or goggles for NPCs have also been addressed (ie. African American\&apos;s protruding lips cause clipping issues with Legion face masks). There are also problems with NPC inventories, and these have been addressed also. Although credit is where credits due; for most of the important named NPCs do happen to look reasonably created and far more distinctive than Fallout 3\&apos;s unique NPCs. However, there are still countless NPCs with unacceptable styles, such as bright hair, pale skin or just being plain ugly.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes[/color][/b] is a separated esm from Complete which just contains fixes to activators, ingestibles, ammunitions, armor, cells, classes, containers, creatures, dialogue topics, doors, object effects, factions, form lists, globals, head parts, lights, leveled items, messages, base effects, misc items, notes, npcs, packages, perks, projectiles, quests, recipes, scripts, sounds, actor effects, statics, terminals, texture sets, weapons, worldspaces, etc. They all are my fixes and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as NVEC BugFixes but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url].
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Enhancements[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that just contains enhancements and no bugfixes. Contains improvements, changes, expansions, tweaks, reduced annoyances, and basically making FNV badass and how it should have been in the 1st place. It\&apos;s my enhancements and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Reduce CTD[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that repairs [url=http://pastebin.com/X1Eakfup]errors/warnings[/url] in FNV and DLC ESMs reported by [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url]. This results in quests, loading worldspaces/cells, roaming the wastes, and basically running FNV in general with considerably less crashes. This plugin is how this mod all got started and where my skills mostly are.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Extras - MCM[/color][/b] is an optional plugin made separately towards the Mod Config Menu. It requires the Mod Config Menu and NVSE. It only contains the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39997]FPS Weapon Wheel[/url] at the moment. THIS PLUGIN IS STRICTLY FOR MCM MODS ONLY
[color=#FFD700][b]More Perks Merge[/color][/b] is a version of Dree\&apos;s More Perks combining all his esps/esms into one esm. Includes More Perks, More Traits, More Perks for Companions, and all his updates. The fomod installation is designed to output the NO DLC and DLC as the same name. Check lower for proper installation.

Thank you for choosing NVEC :D
Installations are packaged into [url=http://www.7-zip.org]7zips[/url]. Any bugs you find with NVEC and the vanilla game please report them to the comments section. I keep track of all bugs reported by users so don\&apos;t be shy.

[color=#FFD700]NVEC Complete[/color] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one. 
If you want everything install NVEC Complete OR NVEC Complete + NVCE. This has everything NVEC has to offer and it\&apos;s made into one esm file instead of three separate plugins. 
If you decide that you do not want to install complete you can choose from which modules you want to install(Reduce CTD, BugFixes, and Enhancements).

[list]
[*]Check the \&quot;NVEC LOAD ORDER EXAMPLE\&quot; a little lower so you know what you want to get before downloading anything
[*]Check your load order Vs [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/EnhancementModInclusions.html]Enhancement Mod Inclusions List[/url] + [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/BugfixModInclusions.html]BugFix Mod Inclusions List[/url] so you don\&apos;t have a mod running that\&apos;s already included. Remove the esps/esms from the already included mods. Uninstalling the already included mods is recommended to save space.
[*]Download what you want from the download section (this should be obvious what to do by now)
[*]Each download is not made towards NMM or a fomod so I recommend to manually install NVEC by opening with [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7zip[/url] then drag and drop into your FNV Data Folder (Your computer skills scare me if you don\&apos;t know how to do this)

[*]Then you will download the merged more perks esm from the NVEC optional downloads and use FOMM - Package manager, since it\&apos;s a fomod
[*]Then you will see the More Perks esm in your load order and make sure it\&apos;s checked before playing

[/list]
[color=#FFD700]Uninstall Weapon Wheel:[/color]
[list]

 The Goodsprings gas station has been changed into a player home for you to use.
ANYONE WANT TO UPLOAD SOME IMAGES, (IF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY KEPT THE MOD) BECAUSE ITS ONLY LETTING ME UPLOAD THE ONE?
This is my first mod and i am kinda new to using the G.E.C.K though i have an idea of what to do.
READ THIS BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!
when you enter the gas station there are 2 enclave style chests on your right, i am not sure if any possessions you put in there will reset after being in the chest for a while, so be careful about putting anything valuable in there. I will test this out soon myself i will then let you know.
Install:
its not difficult lol
1. Download the file from the file tab
2. Unrar the file to a temporary location such as your desktop
3. Place the file in the fallout new vegas data file which is usually located in your program files folder.
4. Click on your fallout launcher then click data files and click the check box for goodspringshome.esp
It would be better if you activated this mod after you have finished the quest involving the man who is already hiding there.</thetext>

Restores Chinese Stealth Armor to the functionality of the Operation Anchorage version from Fallout 3, adding +5 Stealth Field and the stealthboy style invisibility cloak when crouching. These effects are added to the Stealth Suit MK II in Old World Blues.
The Stealth Suit MK II is also changed to Light Armor classification at a weight of 20 wg with the light armor sound signature to mimic the Chinese Stealth Armor.
Durability of both armors/suits has been set to 400 health to mimic the Operation Anchorage version of the Chinese Stealth Armor.
DT of the Stealth Suit MKII was also increased to 15 to match a full suit of Chinese Stealth Armor
Installation:
Just drop the StealthSuitsFix.esp into the Data folder under your Fallout New Vegas Directory and select it in the Data Files list of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher.

It&apos;s very simple: This mod will make it so that you start off the game at Doc Mitchell&apos;s house wearing the Patient Gown from Old World Blues. Pretty much exactly how Old World Blues starts, in fact. The mod also removes the patient gown from your inventory as soon as Doc Mitchell gives you the vault suit. This is for balance: absurdly, the Patient Gown has a higher DT than the (leather!) vault suit, and is worth 200 caps. So it was either remove the gown at the door, or reduce the stats on the gown. And, anyway, it seemed reasonable for Doc Mitchell to just take the gown back.</thetext>

This mod removes the 5 games limit placed upon caravan-playing merchants and makes it so that one can play caravan with such merchants infinitely.
The mod works by replacing the dialogue condition which invokes the caravan game script if found true. By default, the game takes a running total of the number of games of caravan played with a specific capped NPC and only permits the caravan invoking dialogue to be displayed if the number of games played with an NPC is less than 5. This mod replaces the &apos;less than 5&apos; condition with &apos;while not equal to -1&apos;. Since the running total can never be equal to minus one (it starts at zero and increments by positive one with each use of the dialogue) the condition will always be found true and the dialogue displayed. This effectively removes the limit.
The following NPCs will be affected:
Cliff Briscoe
Johnson Nash
Lacey
Quartermaster Mayes
I have tested this very limitedly and it works retroactively. Testing conditions involved a save file with Cliff Briscoe at full 5 games and no caravan dialogue displayed without the mod. With the mod enabled on said save file Cliff&apos;s caravan dialogue re-appeared and the game worked as intended.
I hope you enjoy this mod. Caravan is a really fun game when one gets past the poorly explained rules and it&apos;s a shame they felt the need to place this arbitrary restriction upon the way we choose to play the game.
EDIT:
Lacey is currently being problematic. She&apos;s refusing to display the caravan dialogue even if all conditions are removed. This appears to start after the caravan trading company quest line is progressed so I assume some sort of trigger is activating. I&apos;ll look into it and try to fix this by version 1.1.
All other caravan limited merchants seem to be working fine.
EDIT V1.1: As of version 1.1 Lacey appears to be working fine. The vCaravanQuestScript has been modified to remove the count for games played by caravan limited merchants.</thetext>

this .esp makes use of all the models that i&apos;ve created. While it doesnt make the whole landscape full of trees or anything you&apos;ll occasionally encounter foresty areas near water and sometimes near mountains. The desert plains has been populated with a larger variety of cacti, dead trees and different Joshuas and Yuccas. There&apos;s also more flowers and shrubs in this version.</thetext>

+++DESCRIPTION+++
This mod adds in an SVT-40. It comes with unique static and sound entries, as well as having it added to the appropriate repair, vendor, and leveled lists.
It can be found under Doc Mitchell\&apos;s bedroom wardrobe.
+++COMPATIBILITY+++
This mod should not conflict with any other mod.
+++KNOWN ISSUES+++
* The reload animation for the lever is going to be a little awkward - that is to say, the animation will show that it\&apos;s pulling back on it and pushing it forward, but it won\&apos;t move. That\&apos;s because there are no appropriate animations for the combation of hand grip, attack, and reload animations for this gun altogether. For example, we can animate the lever and the magazine perfectly at the cost of the handgrip holding the rifle like a pistol grip or we can get the handgrip and lever working normally, but the magazine reload is awkward. We can not find a perfect combination that we\&apos;re happy with, so this is as good as it gets.
* The lever clips through the back of the gun on every shot. Without altering the design of the gun, which fans would instantly tell, or modifying the animations, which we can\&apos;t do, there isn\&apos;t really a fix for this either.

I am sure something similar has been uploaded but my friend asked me to make this for him a couple of minutes ago, so I did, and I thought I would upload it aswell. This mod removes Veronica\&apos;s default rags and leaves her with, no clothes at all. My friend was oddly specific about that part of the mod.</thetext>

In vats, if you fire a minigun, alot of times the sound wont even start before youve fired all your shots.
This fixes that by making it use the 10mm smg sound for each individual shot whilst still playing the twirling barrels soundloop in the background.
Simple fix really, that should have been in a patch for FO3 if you ask me. But it got carried over to new vegas... i guess they had too many other bugs to fix before touching this one :P</thetext>

I made this for myself because I felt that the anti-materiel rifle\&apos;s scope magnification was a bit low. I changed the scope FOV from 28 to 10, which results in the magnification being increased by just over 2.5x.
The drawback of this is that the landscape can be pretty ugly at longer distances. But that was the case anyway - you just couldn\&apos;t see it as easily before.</thetext>

            <thetext>http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=42600
Made a M2 Flamethrower for Fallout NV.  There are two flamethrowers in the wasteland right now.  One behind the gas station in Good Springs and one behind the NCR boarder outpost up north.  The Flamethrower uses a modified incinerator projectile with a 200/200 mag capacity.  This is a short ranged weapon and the napalm will burn up before it contacts the ground if you aim too high.  It is really good for clearing boomer mine fields and enclosed caves and hall ways with a lot of enemy.
I\&apos;d like to have the flame thrower equip the tanks when equipped but I have no scripting experience.
If somebody would like to make me a script to do this that would be much obliged. but until then You\&apos;ll have to equip them separate.
The weapon uses no fuel because I did not want any reloading animations.  So it uses the \&quot;recharge\&quot; and needs fixed when it breaks.
I also suck at texturing so if somebody would like to help me with that or make a texture pack for this that would also be nice.
other than that just copy and paste the files to their paths to install.
If there is still a problem with the textures TELL ME.  I\&apos;ll do my best to fix them.

Description:
This mod adds a map marker for the Lucky 38 so you don\&apos;t have to go through Freeside to get there. I recommend downloading this mod because it is a lot easier than walking through the gate every time you want to go to The Strip. It automatically shows up in your pip-boy as an undiscovered place so just go there and you will discover it and then you\&apos;ll be able to fast-travel to it.
Installation: 
Install with a mod manager or manually by dropping the .esp into your Fallout New Vegas data folder.</thetext>

Description : 
This home does not have weapons,food etc inside ! If you want one of those mods, than this one is not for you, this is for the players who love realism and love to fill their home with items themselves not f%^$^$ find it full of amunition and weapons ...
After trying countless player homes i decided to learn how to use Geck and make my own. 
This mod adds a player home in north Goodsprings.
The home was no used and had no interior. So i \&apos;ve replaced the weak wooden door with a big steel wall, you don\&apos;t want a rotten wood door in such a dangerous environment. You need a strong door to protect your riches from those pesky raiders, and prevent your sexy companions from getting raped.
Leave some companions  outside the home also. To stand guard :P 
The special feature of the house is \&quot;le sexy room\&quot; :D A place where you can keep your companions naked or half naked and watch them DANCE !! Or do some other things to them .. 
- Home and outside is navmeshed so your followers can follow 
- Home has many idle positions, so if you let your followers inside to relax, they will dance, smoke and do other things.
- Home has kitchen, bathroom, science room, living room,  armory, 2 hallways and le sexy room
- Home is full of lights :) No more dark rooms, and alot of display places to put all your favorite items on display :D Alot of place to display your collection. 
I LOVE TO LEAVE FOOD AND DRINKS ON TABLES AND SEE THAT THE COMPANIONS EAT/DRINK THEM :X 
Instalation : Extract in Data folder and activate :) 
EXTRA :
Mod that lets you have sex with NPC\&apos;s and companions :

UPGRADING TO THE .ESM - READ THIS
Upgrading to the .esm will mean you have to start over with the mod, but means you won&apos;t have to start over if you wanna install Niner II.
Meet Niner. He’s a drug fueled, untamed street rat with a level of finesse that sits somewhere between a dog and a slightly angrier dog.
He’s also a starry eyed, battle scarred, loyal drinking buddy who just needs a good friend to give him the occasional nudge to keep him on the straight and narrow. 
Make that a powerful shove.
Niner is a fully voiced companion mod with other 480 lines of spoken dialog.
You’ll find him on the road between Goodsprings and Primm, shouting at an inanimate object.
Features:
Over 480 lines of fully voiced dialog.
His own story and quests. His quests will lead you on the road to Vegas, stopping off to take care of a little... business on the way.
Side quests, usually born from an inebriated state.
As you get to know him, learn more of his story and past.
He comments on many locations you take him to in the Mojave Wasteland.
Comments on the events of many vanilla quests, especially those that take place on the road to Vegas.
Completely custom outfit and quest rewards.
A headset which you can use to keep in touch with him.</thetext>

2. REQUIREMENTS
The New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE), version 2.10b (or newer), must be installed and loaded with the game.
The JIP Selective-Fire is required by the new weapons in this mod.
It is HIGHLY recommended (if not vital) that you use joefoxx082&apos;s &quot;Weapon Animation Replacers&quot; (both “The Commando” and “The Professional” packs; only the core animations are required). Though not tested, using the stock (vanilla) animations may result in animation glitches.
3. INSTALLATION
Using either the Nexus Mod Manager, or the Fallout Mod Manager (recommended):
Install in exactly the same way you would install any other mod. If prompted to overwrite existing files, be sure to select &apos;Yes to all&apos;.
Install manually:
1. Extract the .zip file, and then the .fomod file (may require 7-Zip) into your Fallout: New Vegas &apos;data&apos; folder.
2. Open what mod manager you use and make sure “Lone Gunman&apos;s Tools of Trade.esm” is checked.
Updating older versions:
If you are currently using version 0.9.5 or later, then you can simply install the new version over any older ones. Otherwise, BEFORE installing a newer version, you MUST do the following:
For versions 0.8.0 and earlier:
1. Load your most recent saved game.
2. Return to Aguilars’ Last Option and retrieve any item you have left there that you would mind losing.
3. Leave the hideout, save, and exit the game.
4. Uninstall the mod, and then install the new version.
The mod will reset, and you will therefore have to repeat the quest, right from the beginning. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.
For versions 0.9.0 and earlier:
1. Uninstall the mod.
2. Download and install ‘JIP Selective-Fire’ (see ‘Requirements’ section, above).
3. Install the new version.
Your game will be unchanged. However, some settings (Hotkeys, HUD Indicator, etc.) will be reset to their default values</thetext>

Hi!
This is a mod written to remove the invisible collision walls found across the wasteland mountains.
Just checked it with FNVedit, seems pretty clean. ITM/UDR counts both 0.
No idea about where to chuck it in the load order, I&apos;ll leave it to you pro&apos;s :)</thetext>

[center][b]ULTIMATE INVISIBLE WALL REMOVER[/b]
Collision markers are placed for numerous reasons, commonly to decrease load on the physics engine, cover for meshes that the player can walk through, or to prevent the player from moving to an area on the map entirely or until a designated point is reached (the latter isn\&apos;t exactly applicable to New Vegas). These collision markers can place noticeable restrictions on the player. Most noticeably when trying to scale mountains, but also in other situations, such as trying to walk under a boardwalk, climbing atop piles of rubble, or attempting to reach the barbed wire on those billboard walls around the Strip and Freeside. Ultimate Invisible Wall Remover seeks to remove these annoyances not only from the Mojave Wasteland, but from every worldspace spanning all DLCs, as well as interiors. This mod has been created entirely in [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url], filtering for Collision Markers and going through them one by one, disabling those that won\&apos;t cause issues (such as having the ability to walk through walls). The end result is a comprehensive and all-inclusive invisible wall remover that won\&apos;t contain the dirty edits or -30000 z coordinates that cause many issues in worldspace modifying mods. All of the disabled Invisible Walls have had their enable state flagged as opposite to the player character.
If you find any invisible walls that I\&apos;ve missed, or run into any problems, please report them in the comments section and I\&apos;ll to see to it that they\&apos;re fixed.
Enjoy a New Vegas free of invisible walls.
[b]CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING[/b]
Before you begin, I suggest you read [url=http://www.formspring.me/JESawyer/q/400723116738768512]this[/url] post by Josh Sawyer, the project director and lead designer of Fallout: New Vegas. The post details why invisible walls were placed and the purpose they serve. Be aware that this mod can detract from your gameplay experience due to the fact that NPCs cannot move outside of the boundaries collision markers placed on the map. As a result, it is possible the player can find a space where they\&apos;re invulnerable because their enemies can\&apos;t reach them. Of course, you can avoid this by avoiding those spaces, but if you feel this will be an issue for you, don\&apos;t download this mod. Also be aware that Ultimate Invisible Wall Remover requires Fallout: New Vegas (Obviously), Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road. They\&apos;re called FalloutNV.esm, DeadMoney.esm, HonestHearts.esm, OldWorldBlues.esm, and LonesomeRoad.esm in your data folder. 
[b]INSTALLATION[/b]
Once you\&apos;ve read the notes above and have made sure Ultimate Invisible Wall Remover is suitable for you, simply drag and drop Ultimate Invisible Wall Remover.esp into your Fallout: New Vegas data folder. Alternatively, you could use [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36901]FOMM[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/modmanager]Nexus Mod Manager[/url].
[b]PERMISSIONS[/b]
You can use this for anything you wish without giving credit, as long as it isn\&apos;t for profit.[/center]</thetext>

Details
=======
This mod provides 4 IDLEs for female player character and 4 IDLEs for male player character. The idles are chosen at random.
The idle is only played when you&apos;re not moving. Basically, this &quot;replaces&quot; the basic, gender-shared mtidle.kf with more idles.
To that end, this mod supplies you with animations taken from the game&apos;s sources. 
Female:
\Data\meshes\characters\_male\idleanims\femaleidle\femaleidleA.kf (originally dialogbodyshiftrightfemalelistena)
\Data\meshes\characters\_male\idleanims\femaleidle\femaleidleB.kf (originally ttpntrlarmscrossedlistena)
\Data\meshes\characters\_male\idleanims\femaleidle\femaleidleC.kf (originally ttpcolautumhandbehindtalk)
\Data\meshes\characters\_male\idleanims\femaleidle\femaleidleD.kf (originally sirelaxedc)
Male:

INTRODUCTION
This system was, originally, tailor-made for weapons included in another mod I created (Lone Gunman&apos;s Tools of Trade). Considerably improved and expanded, it is now offered as a universal system, affecting all compatible weapons, both vanilla and any other weapons added by 3rd party content, and with special emphasis on:
Universal compatibility:
This system does not rely, in any way, on pre-determined weapon classification. Rather, it evaluates each weapon&apos;s parameters (such as the weapon&apos;s type, rate of fire, animation type, mods attached, etc.) and accurately determines which fire-mode selection would be most appropriate for it, in terms of realism and practicality (it is also possible to customize each weapon&apos;s fire-modes configuration). Therefore, it does not (and will not) require any compatibility patches for present nor future mods.
Quick, simple installation:
Save for NVSE (which, by now, has become practically household), requires no other mods/components in order to work.
Fully-automated installation - without having to manually modify any game files.</thetext>

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

4. CRAFTING WEAPON MODS
===============
WMX adds a number of new crafting recipes to the workbench crafting menu, as well as several new items (listed below) to be used as parts in these recipes. Most of these recipes are for melee weapon mods, but a couple are for ranged weapon mods. All of them fall under a new crafting menu category: \&quot;Weapon Mods\&quot;.
These are the new items added by WMX to be used as crafting parts. They can be bought from merchants or scavenged from the Wasteland:
- Blade Blank

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.
===============
5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.
================================
11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.
- Fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations are by Joefoxx.
- Many, many icons by The 3rd Type (and many by me too).

- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).
- Changed scope mod design for Brush Gun to accommodate shells being ejected from the top of the weapon if it has the Brush Gun Forged Receiver weapon mod applied; now uses scope from La Longue Carabine.
- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)
- Fixed tangent space for a range of weapon meshes.
- Fixed alpha-sorting issue on AER14 Prototype stock.
- Reduced chance of finding weapon mods in loot.
- Laser RCW, Plasma Defender and Recharger Pistol now affected by Energy Resistance (same as all other Energy weapons).
- Changed ejected shell casing mesh used by several weapons (in line with what\&apos;s in the Community Bugfix Compilation).
Version 1.0 (16-01-11)
- Initial public release.</thetext>

28.03.2013: Oh guys I made a very serious mistake by naming the ESP differently. So unless you took everything out of this place before updating the files (or started a new game afterwards) you will have lost almost every stashed item. I am really really really sorry. In future the ESP will be named continously: AWOP GS House Overhaul.
And now the good news: The next update is on it\&apos;s way and should be ready in about 2 or 3 weeks. I already extended the armory a second time so the new weapon containers could fit in. I hope you will like them. Also hope I can add the trophy room for the next update. Scripting is still new to me, so it is really challenging for what I have in mind. We\&apos;ll see what I can finish (and learn) in the coming days....
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What has begun with \&quot;I want to use this place but I definately need named containers in the armory\&quot;, ended with an complete overhaul. Everything is brighter, cleaner and a bit bigger.
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
These are the benefits you also get:
-Relocated Armory with named containers for every standard ammo, different weapon containers and different armor containers, containers for weapon repair kits and mods
-Three named containers for ammo reloading, workbench crafting and a cabinet for magazines (like Future Weapons Today because I usually don\&apos;t carry all around).
-Two named fridges in the kitchen for food and water/liquor.
-A chemistry set in the infirmary where you can get either 2 psycho or 2 Med-X once per gameday.
-A working oven in the kitchen
-Meet General Staal\&apos;s Personal Barber in the bathroom, a Protectron who can\&apos;t walk or talk but can give you a new haircut; for fans of the TV series \&quot;Doctor Who\&quot; the name General Staal could ring a bell
-Snow globe display (V1.1) that works along with the one in the Lucky 38. Only for globes you have not delivered yet!
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
REQUIREMENTS:
A World Of Pain by djmystro (who gave permission to upload this)
********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
INSTALLING:
I recommend to use FOMM (which I use) or NMM
If you are already using this place: get everything out of every container and if you placed items outside containers pack them up as well BEFORE INSTALLING this mod. Otherwise you risk to loose your stuff. The blue trunk in the cave section should be a save place.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
FUTURE PLANS:
-Companions can be sent to the basement; I already set every named container to be ignored by sandbox
-adding a trophy room
-adding support for Sortomatic (will be done when everything else is finished)

Simply renames the \&quot;M\&quot; modified weapons added by AWOP to use FOOK\&apos;s naming system. I replaced the M with X for aesthetic reasons. No other stats were changed.
I did my best, anyway.
Requires AWorldOfPain(Preview).esm as a master.

Stay organized, my friends.

No backstory this time around ... [i]*cough*[/i] about \&apos;Ravens Nest\&apos; being the call sign for the Forest Service Fire Crew stationed here before the war and how the couriers had since taken it over as a northwest way station ... the main thing is you\&apos;re here now and it\&apos;s yours if you want it.
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=#ffa500][b]House Features[/b][/color]:
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[list]
[*]Sleep space for seven including the very first (that I know of) pull-out double bed sofa - activated with a side lever.
[*]A massive stone fireplace.  I would really love it if someone with the expertise would \&apos;gimp\&apos; a descent resource for this game, but this one isn\&apos;t too bad for a highly disguised hack-job.
[*]You can turn all lights on and off, close and open all window shutters; find storage where there was none before with activators at the source.
[*]You can set the dinner table for a two-place setting or a four-place setting. Activators are on the wall and will remove items from the shelves and place them on the table and also move a chair into position at the table. (Hope someone isn\&apos;t already sitting in that chair or they\&apos;re in for a surprise!)  You supply the food and drink if you wish.
[*]The stove, not your run-of-the-mill stove, will allow you to turn on the back burners from the front control panel which will in turn either get the coffee perking or bubble up some hot stew which you can partake of when the burner is on.  The stove also has the usual in-game recipes as well.
[*]There\&apos;s a small glass display in the corner desk area which you can open, remove or keep the mask inside, and place your own trophies in it.
[*]There are three weapon cases in the living area that serve as containers and decoration:  one contains the requisite rifle over the mantle (anything can go inside but the cowboy repeater will always show), another is designated for melee, and there\&apos;s a pistol case on the desk.  There are several weapon lockers in the bedroom besides as well as ammo storage.
[*]Anyone familiar with the \&quot;RCtable\&quot; knows it has supposed storage underneath that you could never access .. until now.  That one\&apos;s been redone for the bedroom as a washstand.
[*]An outdoor workroom - canvas awning lifts by activator to provide an open space with an overhang and gives access to the workbench and reloader with actual barrel containers below.
[*]A raised deck for taking in the view or for lounging at the table.  Umbrella is optional and kept in storage nearby.
[*]A two-seater outhouse is located at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the cabin .. convenient but not too close for obvious reasons.
[*]A large bath .. in the form of a lake (you\&apos;re using biodegradable soap of course) is at the bottom of the hill along with a small pier, working campfire with seating; a log-couch lakeside for soaking your feet.
[*]Solar energy ... uhh, sure thing, gary.  Sorry, I get tired of using the same old kerosene lanterns away from power and the noisy generators one needs for electricity otherwise.
[*]A few garden grown crops..some pickable.
[*]A relock activator on the door - ONLY works if the door is currently STANDING OPEN not just unlocked. [old script I had laying around]  You can access the control from inside or out.
[*]A manually operated weapon stand in the front hall for that quick grab to investigate strange noises in the night.
[/list]
Some of the items placed about are untypically stats - you can\&apos;t pick \&apos;em up: like the items hanging in the front hall, the books (don\&apos;t you just hate that when you pick one up and the rest either fall or sit an inch above the shelf?); the dinner table items.
Above all I hope this cabin provides a nice bit of ambience and an interactive quality to make it as immersive a game-play experience for you as possible.  I\&apos;m really enjoying it, but I\&apos;m probably a bit prejudiced.
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=#ffa500][b]Advantages and Two Issues up front[/b][/color]:
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
This is an external cell construct.
On the upside - 
[list]
[*]The views (and outdoor sounds) through the windows and door are real-time .. a most important feature considering the surrounding landscape. 
[*]There are no portals - I don\&apos;t care for those time-consuming loading screens anyway, and this is especially good for your modded companions\&apos; ability to roam freely throughout the house and grounds when given leave to do so.  They typically need a settling in time before they really get to moving about - usually a couple of game days, but afterward they can become a contstant source of entertainment.
[*]Lighting in the home will naturally change with the sun\&apos;s passing.
[*]Enemies can follow you right into the unlocked house .. reason enough to learn how to use the relock on the door especially when sleeping.  Also a good idea to close the shutters...you can shoot through those screens.
[/list]
On the downside -
[list] 
[*]You can\&apos;t use weather mods with this home as it\&apos;s not weatherproof.  Simply uncheck the use of those mods before using \&quot;Ravens Nest\&quot; and be cursed with fair weather until you activate them again later on.  Seems as though \&quot;Nevada Skies\&quot; likes to play havoc with the lay of the land as well - causes items on the privy level to float and items at the house level to be underground.  Go figure.
[*]Unlike most of the interior cell designed homes (which probably comprise at least 95% of modded and in-game homes) there is much more for the cell to load outside, as in this case, so expect a drop in your frame rate.  I use nothing other than in-game sources and introduce no new textures to add to the burden, but it will happen nevertheless.  My low-end, non-gaming computer handles the game and this house with very little difficulty, though I\&apos;ve no doubt that some will experience prohibitive slowdowns since they\&apos;re running high-texture settings and a list full of frame-eating mods (ie. new high-rez weapons, clothing, landscapes; etc.) already on a computer that can barely handle it. (I\&apos;ve seen your videos on YouTube and wonder why.)  If none of the aforementioned apply to you and you\&apos;re still walking in quicksand, you have my regrets and suggest that this mod is not for you .. for now and on your current rig.
[/list]
In my book the upside wins for external cell homes...even though, as most modders who\&apos;ve attempted them will tell you, they\&apos;re a bugger to make as there are no easy solutions to hiding stuff above ground and getting it to work with the landscape.  It simply has to fit.
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=#ffa500][b]Location and Key[/b][/color]:
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
Located southeast of Jacobstown with a map marker to steer the way there and for fast-travel later on.
Key is under the rock just to the right of the door with an extra in the bedroom.  (I\&apos;ve actually made use of that extra key when making the house - doubt you\&apos;ll need it or have use for it.)
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=#ffa500][b]Which file to use* and 3 recommendations[/b][/color]:
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
*Use the main file for your game.  It has been cleaned and mastered and also has a warning attached to it in FOMM and also in the manager that you must ignore.  It states something to the effect that this is an esp file that has the esm tag.  True.  And it is automatically placed there when running MasterUpdate in FNVEdit ... so don\&apos;t sweat it or change the file in any way.  To do so would undoubtedly cause your game to crash.  
*I also include a GECK file for those who\&apos;d rather have it their way without the need to MasterRestore in FNVEdit first. Have fun, and you should be sure to clean and master when your through with your changes.  FYI - reference the \&quot;Aeries\&quot; files.  There is no internal cell (despite my having initiated one) - only an exterior.
Though not required for this file to work [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34888]Fellout NV[/url] by Hattix is a must for you to see the lighting effects that are a big part of this mod.  Get it, please.
Your trigger finger gettin\&apos; itchy? - download [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/37067]Zombie Apocalypse[/url] by Foxtrot and have moving targets spawning all over the place.  It\&apos;s wonderful for target practice and for satisfying your bloodlust.  Just don\&apos;t save your game when using it.
Lastly, so many of you seem to require or, to be fair, just really like sorters for your stash and would not consider a home without one.  If you are one of those give [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44104]The Backpack[/url] by TRoaches and Keleigh3000 a try.  You could just plop it on an empty bed or in a corner somewhere and move your stuff around from there..or not.  I\&apos;ve tried it and it works as it\&apos;s supposed to.  Requires NVSE.
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=#ffa500][b]Installation and Required Files[/b][/color]:
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
Install:  Download zip file, unzip, and place esp file and meshes folder in your Fallout New Vegas/Data folder. Answer \&quot;Yes\&quot; to merge of meshes folder.  Or simply use the \&quot;Download With Manager\&quot;. You really should get the Nexus Mod Manager.  It\&apos;s a terrific utility.
Uninstall:  Remove RavensNest.esp and the \&quot;Aeries\&quot; folder from within your meshes folder. Or, once again, let the Nexus Mod Manager do it for you.
Required Files: None
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
[color=#ffa500][b]Updates[/b][/color]:
[color=#008000]-------------------------------------------------[/color]
V2 gives the lake water a unique identifier...the only change.  Hopefully this will solve the problem of the water disappearing with a few people.  The file is complete with the esp and meshes folder so if you already have V1 and wish to update I recommend you get everything you wish to keep along with yourself out of the house and do a clean save before installing V2.

This mod silently keeps non-default uGridsToLoad values from &quot;infecting&quot; your savegames,
allowing it to be safely increased and decreased without the need to clean up saves
manually.
I&apos;ve made this mainly for the upcoming XRE releases (RTR, SA) which are designed to run best with a higher active grids range.

There are some minor graphics glitches, as I was trying very hard to force the interior to match the exteriors,  I found it was like trying to build a puzzle with only two thirds of the pieces. You may notice some sealing overlaps, or flashing.

Introduction
===========
Hey there wastelanders.
I just started an evil play through, using Igli\&apos;s great slaver mods \&quot;Slavery Simple\&quot; and \&quot;Slavery Expanded\&quot;.
But I found myself in need of a place, to store the precious merchandise and plot my evil schemes.
I took a look at Spillz\&apos; \&quot;Slave Jail\&quot; and got inspired to make my own version of it, so here it is.
*UPDATE*
Added a fast travel point for easy access :)
========
Contents
========
Removed the boards and added an interior to the house next to Doc Mitchell\&apos;s.
It\&apos;s pretty much a default interior, but I might update it later. 
Behind the house there\&apos;s a hatch leading to a small control room, with access to the private quarters and a hidden door to the slave area. Slavers aren\&apos;t exactly popular folk, so the extra secrecy is always welcome ;)
The slave area contains 4 cells with switch operated locking mechanisms.
-Holding area
-Torture chamber
-Dexter\&apos;s Lab (for lack of a better name)
-Skin flick studio :P
And finally there\&apos;s a utility room at the end of the hall, with a workbench and a reload bench, plus some materials.  
==========
Installation
==========
Easy peasy lemon squeezy, just put the file in the New Vegas Data folder and activate it using the launcher or FOMM.

Notes
=====
This mod shouldn\&apos;t conflict with any other mods as far as I know, unless you are already using Spillz Slave Jail.
If that is the case and you would like to use both, lemme know and I\&apos;ll relocate my version.    
AI Behaviour on the slaves is a bit weird sometimes, I\&apos;m thinking it\&apos;s either a NavMesh issue or something to do with Igli\&apos;s slaver mods.
If anyone wants to take a look at my NavMesh and make sure that it\&apos;s okay, feel free to do so :)
Not happy with the location in Goodsprings? or got something else on your mind? then fire away, all feedback is welcome :)
Thanks goes out to the people, who helped me iron out some kinks I was having with my hidden door, you know who you are ;D
And Spillz for the inspiration!</thetext>

[color=Green][size=4]Description:[/size][/color]
[color=Green]-------------------------[/color]
This mod Is a bunch of conversions for the T6M, T6BB, TN, &amp; BerryK2 Bodies.  It also adds outfit pieces (i.e. Bra\&apos;s Panties, Shorts, Stockings, etc) for mix \&apos;n matching outfits.  All pieces are bounce enabled so you will need a bounce enabled skeleton to use these meshes.  Bodies (if needed and you are not using any of my other conversion files) are in a folder under \&quot;Docs\&quot;. All the outfits are in a couple of suitcases in the trailer by \&quot;Goodsprings Source\&quot;  Where the tutorial with Sunny ends.
You can easily get the wearable bodies in-game by clicking on the measuring tape located on one of the suitcases.
What are these bodies?
----------------------------------
The Type-N body is The Type-V body with the narrow shoulders &amp; smaller hands fixes applied. (Original TypeV by Luchaire, Type-N made by Nessa)
The Type6BB body is the Type3BB body with some alterations in the same line as the Type 6 body.  (Original body by 2pac4eva7, the changes were made by Necroscope.)
The Type6M or Type6Modified body is an edit of the Type6 body.  (Original Type6 by Necroscope, Type6M changes by Izumiko.)
The BerryK2 body is a combination of the BerryHD Body &amp; Alice Body. Original bodies by Dimon99, Combination done by Kendo2)
[color=Green][size=3]Manual Installation:[/size][/color]
[color=Green]---------------------------------[/color]
After the original mods have been installed just overwrite the meshes with these which have bounce added.  You WILL NEED the bouncing skeleton to use these meshes.  you can get the skeleton from [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35047]this mod.[/url]
[color=Green][size=3]Manual Uninstallation:[/size][/color]
[color=Green]-----------------------------------[/color]

Description
===========
Fallout Who Vegas brings the TARDIS to the Mojave Wasteland, and not just as a portable home... 
traverse the Desert in style, with 100 landing locations to visit, a plethora of controls to manipulate, a 
menagerie of systems to customise and a labyrinth of wonderful rooms to explore.
Set to the backdrop of a mysterious quest thrusting you into the Courier&apos;s near future, questions must 
be answered and mysteries must be solved...
Details
=======
- 2 new and unique Skill Trees tailored to life aboard the TARDIS; Piloting and Temporal Engineering
- 100 Mojave locations to visit at random
- 3 very different Flight Modes to unlock and utilise; randomise your destination, traverse the Space 
Time Vortex or Programme previously visited locations
- Build and upgrade the Sonic and Laser Screwdrivers, each with very different and unique functions 
from lockpicking to miniaturising your foe to a doll-sized death
- Configure the ships systems; Repair, Refuel and upgrade Auxiliary systems and balance available 
Power to your whim to grant additional rooms within the Ships interior
- A unique Context-Sensitive Response Flight minigame - piloting the TARDIS isn&apos;t just a case of 
pulling a lever and sitting back, not for a novice. Follow the given instructions and respond in time or 
feel the consequences...
- A quest brimmed with intrigue, setting up the plot for upcoming adventures that will challenge you 
mentally and skillfully...
Install
=======
** IMPORTANT **
NVSE Must be installed and up to date for this Mod to work correctly - bugs and game breaking 
errors will be the result of poor installation and/or incorrectly installed NVSE files
http://nvse.silverlock.org/ 
**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**
Follow the below link (intended for Fallout 3, however works exactly the same way for Fallout New 
Vegas)...
http://wiki.tesnexus.com/index.php/How_to_install_mods_for_Fallout_3
*COMMON INSTALLATION ISSUES*
- Red exclamation mark meshes ingame are caused by the incorrect installation of essential mod files
- Borked Textures are also the result of incorrect installation
Starting the Mod
================
Simply get your head down in a Bed somewhere for the night and let the adventure begin...
Hints &amp; Tips
============
- Hit the &apos;M&apos; Key at any time to toggle on and off Tutorial Mode
- Can&apos;t find something? Try exploring the entire TARDIS...
- The Sonic and Laser Screwdrivers can switch modes once upgraded by hitting the &apos;2&apos; key 
Known Issues or Bugs
====================
- Vanishing TARDIS -
If upon leaving the TARDIS, you have 
noticed the Police Box cannot be seen, but 
can be activated, load from a previous save. 
This is a bug related to the Cell loading order 
of the game, and cannot be fixed or 
modified.
- Repair and Refuel Shader glitch -
The TARDIS exterior applies a shader when repairing and refueling. Unfortunately this is glitched while anti-aliasing is enabled in the game settings. If you&apos;re bothered by it, disable anti-aliasing in your game settings. You can still play with it on, but you&apos;ll need to enable it in video driver settings (whichever you may use)
- Reappearing Tutorials -
You may notice a tutorial could trigger once in each Control Room. If this happens, you can bypass it, or simply turn off Tutorial Mode.

Copied from Description:
&quot;This mod adds two new items to the game: nav beacons and a nav beacon remote Control. The nav beacons are droppable misc items. When a beacon is dropped a new map marker will be created in that spot. The marker can be used for fast travel. The remote control can optionally be used to activate an audio cue that will help you locate a beacon once you are close enough to hear it. The audio cue is disabled by default.&quot;</thetext>

This mod is intended to significantly improve the way companions are controlled and interacted with, effectively rendering the companion-wheel obsolete.
Using a single hotkey, combined with the mouse wheel, middle and right buttons, to control a HUD interface, companions can now be given any companion-wheel order (as well as a handful of new orders), all remotely, in real-time, without having to approach them and initiate dialogue (thereby also pausing the game).
Similar to classic role-playing games, each companion will have his own avatar displayed on the HUD (see images section), with a health bar, and also an indication of his current action (waiting/following/relaxing/in combat etc.).</thetext>

Gribbleshnibit8&apos;s Project Nevada - Extra Options is great, but in version 1.2 there is a tiny script error in the setup script for the Mod Configuration Menu entry for PN Rebalance (and PN Core too) which often leads to it disappearing from the MCM page altogether. This patch fixes the error. Nothing else.
Load Order: At the end, after everything. Or better yet Bashed with Wrye Flash NV</thetext>

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.
===============
5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.

11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.

15. VERSION HISTORY
=================
Version 1.1.1 (29-10-11)
- Added missing crafting recipes for \&apos;Straight Razor Tempered Blade\&apos; and \&apos;Switchblade Tempered Blade\&apos;.
Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).
- Changed scope mod design for Brush Gun to accommodate shells being ejected from the top of the weapon if it has the Brush Gun Forged Receiver weapon mod applied; now uses scope from La Longue Carabine.
- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.
===============
5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.

11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.

15. VERSION HISTORY
=================
Version 1.1.1 (29-10-11)
- Added missing crafting recipes for \&apos;Straight Razor Tempered Blade\&apos; and \&apos;Switchblade Tempered Blade\&apos;.
Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).
- Changed scope mod design for Brush Gun to accommodate shells being ejected from the top of the weapon if it has the Brush Gun Forged Receiver weapon mod applied; now uses scope from La Longue Carabine.
- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)
- Fixed tangent space for a range of weapon meshes.
- Fixed alpha-sorting issue on AER14 Prototype stock.
- Reduced chance of finding weapon mods in loot.
- Laser RCW, Plasma Defender and Recharger Pistol now affected by Energy Resistance (same as all other Energy weapons).

- Initial public release.</thetext>

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.
===============

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.
===============
5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.
================================
11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.

Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).
- Changed scope mod design for Brush Gun to accommodate shells being ejected from the top of the weapon if it has the Brush Gun Forged Receiver weapon mod applied; now uses scope from La Longue Carabine.
- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)
- Fixed tangent space for a range of weapon meshes.
- Fixed alpha-sorting issue on AER14 Prototype stock.
- Reduced chance of finding weapon mods in loot.
- Laser RCW, Plasma Defender and Recharger Pistol now affected by Energy Resistance (same as all other Energy weapons).
- Changed ejected shell casing mesh used by several weapons (in line with what\&apos;s in the Community Bugfix Compilation).
Version 1.0 (16-01-11)
- Initial public release.</thetext>

Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for A World of Pain (AWOP)
Compatibility Patch, Bugfixes, and Minor Tweaks by MadMalachi.
Version 2.1, May 17, 2011.  Uses WMX 1.07 and AWOP 1.1, updated for official FNV patch 1.3.
Many thanks to Antistar and Dj Mystro for permission to release my small contribution based upon their work.
Put simply, this file allows weapons introduced by the excellent \&quot;A World of Pain\&quot; (AWOP) mod by Dj Mystro to use \&quot;Weapon Mods Expanded\&quot; (WMX) by Antistar.  Minor additional bugfixes and tweaks are also included.  The most notable tweaks are that the Recharger Rifle and .223 Pistol / That Gun are more powerful than in the vanilla game.  More details may be found in the readme.
If you have any questions or concerns, please leave feedback.  I can\&apos;t fix problems if I don\&apos;t know they exist.  And if you found this file useful, then please remember to leave endorsements, not only here, but also for A World of Pain and Weapon Mods Expanded as well.  
Have fun!
Installation:  
1. This should be obvious, but this patch requires that you have WMX and AWOP already installed.
[URL=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39651]Weapon Mods Expanded by Antistar[/URL]
[URL=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38719]A World of Pain by Dj Mystro[/URL]
2. Place the .esp file in your data folder.  
3. Using Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM), ensure that this file loads after WeaponModsExpanded.esp.  I use the .esm version of A World of Pain, but if you happen to use the .esp version, then make sure that this file loads after the AWOP .esp file as well.  
4. For best results, place WeaponModsExpanded.esp, then this file and your merge patch at the VERY END of the load order (highest priority), so that they override everything else.  (Don\&apos;t know what a merge patch is?  Download FNVEdit and consult Antistar\&apos;s readme for WMX, or the one he wrote for his Weapon Mod Kits for Fallout 3.  Everything you need to know is right there.  A merge patch is nearly always essential for getting mods to work together properly.)
Changelog:
v. 2.1
- Updated for AWOP 1.1 and WMX 1.07.  Requires the latest Fallout: New Vegas patch, because AWOP requires it.  Many weapons received minor stat adjustments.
v. 2.0 BETA
- Updated for AWOP 1.0.  Uses the official FNV patch 1.3 and WMX 1.06.  Does not use the Madcat update.  I will update this to 2.1 when WMX 1.07 is released -- hopefully this will let people play AWOP 1.0 with WMX in the meantime.  Let me know if there are any problems that seem related to this patch, and I will fix them if I can.
v. 1.9 BETA
- Updated for AWOP .7 and the official FNV patch 1.3.  This should be considered BETA because I used the (now mostly obsolete) version 1.06 of WMX to make it, and not the authorized update by MadCat.  I have no idea if the patch will play nicely with that update, or what the proper load order might be.  If there are problems let me know, and I will attempt a fix.
v. 1.8c
- Minor update for AWOP .6, which adds the Brush Gun M.
v. 1.8b
- Minor update for AWOP .5, which adds the Plasma Caster M.
v. 1.8
- Updated for WMX 1.06 and AWOP .42.
- Grenade Machinegun M uses the new WMX models.
- Statistics on MANY weapons adjusted slightly to reflect AWOP .42 values. No dramatic changes apparent.
v. 1.7b
- Minor update for WMX 1.05.  Tri-Beam Laser Rifle given iron sights and .357 Magnum mod given slightly reduced improved rate of fire -- M versions altered to reflect these changes.
v. 1.7
- Updated for AWOP .4 -- only use this file with AWOP .4 and not some future AWOP Test Version.  New weapons added: Gatling Laser M, 12.7 Submachine Gun M, Tesla Cannon M, Grenade Machinegun M, Missile Launcher M, and Sniper Rifle M.
v. 1.6
- Updated to use WMX version 1.04 and AWOP Test Version 4.  Added all M class weapons found only in the Test Version of AWOP, allowing them to use WMX mods.  USE THIS FILE ONLY WITH AWOP TEST VERSION 4.  To make it absolutely clear, if you do not use the \&quot;Test Version\&quot; of AWOP, then you should use WMX-AWOP 1.5, not this file!
v. 1.5
- Updated for WMX version 1.04.  Laser Pistol M and Laser Rifle M now use the correct WMX 1.04 meshes.
v. 1.4
- Updated for WMX version 1.03.
v. 1.3
- Updated for WMX version 1.02 form repair lists.  M class weapons should now use the updated repair lists as well.
- Slightly reduced damage on the recharger rifle, making it damage-wise on par with the recharger pistol and varmint rifle.
v. 1.2
- Corrected the Multiplas Rifle M to have the proper \&quot;A World of Pain\&quot; statistics.  In particular, the M class variety of this weapon uses 4 ammo instead of 3, but also shoots 4 projectiles instead of the normal 3.
- Adjusted a few M class weapons to be closer to their \&quot;A World of Pain\&quot; statistics.  Generally, this meant a slight reduction in minimum spread, applicable to the following weapons:  Service Rifle M, Lever Action Shotgun M, Light Machine Gun M, .357 Magnum Revolver M, 12.7mm Pistol M, and the Minigun M.
v. 1.1
- Patched four references in \&quot;A World of Pain\&quot; that referred to \&quot;That Gun\&quot; to instead refer to its base variant, the \&quot;.223 Pistol.\&quot;  Mobs of raiders should not all be equipped with the same unique weapon, and I sincerely hope that this fixes the problem.  My thanks to Yoba333 for bringing this issue to my attention.
v. 1.0
- Initial release.  M class weapons from A World of Pain use the appropriate weapon mods from WMX.  Other tweaks and fixes.</thetext>

This mod will allow you to play on after the game&apos;s ending. The slideshow will begin and you will then be loaded into the Wasteland. You will be able to do quests, explore and play other mods normally. In later versions, I will change and adapt the story and world space of the Mojave based on your ending. Every small quest that affected someone or someplace will have an effect after the ending.</thetext>

|Stock Management 1.0|
Pack Rats Rejoice!
This handy-dandy terminal will rummage through your inventory and sort everything out for you into convenient and organized trans-dimensional containers so that you don\&apos;t have to!
Features:
----------
three versions, use only one! :
1. Normal (the terminal is made to place at you home, and not to carry it all the timme. weight of 1000)
2. weightless (same as 1, but weightless)
3. weightless+ (theres no need to place a marker) 
Your handy-dandy terminal will be issued to you automatically. Simply drop the marker wherever you wish and then activate it to spawn the terminal. If you wish to pick the terminal back up, simply crouch down and activate it, remembering to lift with your knees and not your back.
If you use the weightless+ version simply activate the &lt;42&gt; Sort Management+ (located under aid) and the terminal will open in a new window. Now you\&apos;ll have access to everything you own, whenever you need it.
Your terminal will sort the following:
-Ammunition
Don\&apos;t leave home without some!
-Books &amp; Magazines
To be enjoyed later after a long day scavenging in the desert.
-Clutter
One man\&apos;s junk is another man\&apos;s treasure.
-Consumables - Food
Don\&apos;t want your precious food to spoil.
-Consumables - Drinks
Chilled to perfection.
-Consumables - Chems/Meds
Safely stored in a sterilized container.
-Crafting - Workbench/Campfire
Ready to be tinkered with and/or cooked.
-Crafting - Reloading
Mustn\&apos;t waste that ammunition.
Your terminal will not sort the following:
-Armor
The evil gnomes tend to show up more if there\&apos;s sexy sleepwear to be had and they like to grab other things if they are available.
-Weapons
Due to an incident involving a laser rifle and mini-nukes, the terminal is no longer able to sort weapons.

Please note that this took me about 20 hours in total to plan and make, so any endorsements would be appreciated. I did this because I very much enjoy crafting in video games, and I felt that there was no mod or combination of mods that remedies the lack of good crafting (in my opinion) in Fallout: New Vegas. If you have any questions, complaints or advice then please, by all means, post them in the ‘comments’ tab.

I- Description
This mod adds a very large amount of useful, new crafting recipes to the game including weapons, ammunition, explosives, miscellaneous items, etc. Many craftable items require reusable schematics to craft, and you will find these placed realistically in locations across the Mojave Wasteland.
II- Installation Guide
REQUIREMENTS: FNV, of course, and all four main DLC packs. (not GRA or those preorder content things)
INCOMPATIBILITIES: None, it’s just a crafting mod.
With Nexus Mod Manager: Go to the files tab and click ‘Download with Manager’ then doubleclick the downloaded mod. Make sure FNVCI.esp is checked off in the NMM, and put it wherever you want in the load order.
With Fallout Mod Manager: Go to the files tab and click ‘download manually’. Download to whatever location you like. Then, in FOMM in your package manager, click ‘Add FOMOD’ and select the downloaded file. Make sure FNVCI.esp is checked off in the FOMM, and put it wherever you want in the load order.
With Neither: Go to the files tab and click ‘download manually’. Download to whatever location you like. Then, unpack the downloaded file using either the WinRar or 7Zip application. Drag the .esp to your Fallout: New Vegas data folder, wherever that may be. Then, launch the Fallout: New Vegas .exe but do not click ‘play’. Instead, click ‘data files’ and check off the .esp that you downloaded and put in the ‘data’ folder.
III- History
April 3, 2013: Initial release.
April 29, 2013: 1.1 released, see \&apos;files\&apos; section for what changed.
IV- FAQs
Q: In the ‘list of new recipes’, why don’t you include the skill requirements and crafting station for each crafting recipe?
A: Mainly just because I’m lazy sometimes. I forgot to include the skill requirements and crafting stations, and now I don’t feel like putting them in. Rest assured that there are skill requirements and crafting stations, and they are accurate and neither over- nor underpowered in my opinion.
Q: Are you the guy that makes all those Pipboy mods?
A: No, that\\\&apos;s ShilohDS, I\\\&apos;m just plain Shiloh.
Q: How do I find out what the skill requirements are?
A: Either launch the game and find the recipe by activating the recipe’s crafting station, or do as follows:
1. Open the GECK (if you do not have it, get it).
2. Click File--&gt;Data.
3. Make sure FNV.esm and FNVCI.esp are check off, then click ‘OK’.
4. In the Object Window of the GECK, click ‘Miscellaneous’, then ‘Recipe’.
5. All recipes should now show up in the Object Window. Recipes added by me should have the prefix ‘C01C’ in their editor ID.
6. Doubleclick on the editor ID of whatever recipe you want to find the requirements of.
7. In the new window that pops up, you should see the crafting station and skill requirements of that crafting recipe.
Q: Why do some gun recipes require the ‘survival’ skill rather than the ‘repair’ or ‘science’ skill?
A: The weapons that require you to be high enough in the ‘survival’ skill are generally weapons that I thought of as wild-west weapons (meaning the type of weapon I could visualize a cowboy using), and aren’t very complicated. Since, for whatever reason, I associated the wild west with survival, I gave cowboy-type weapons a ‘survival’ skill requirement. I also wanted to balance all the skills used for crafting, and I felt the ‘survival’ skill was underpowered.
Q: Why do so many recipes require flamer fuel?
A: For the sake of realism, I wanted something to heat metal and other materials so that they would be malleable.
Q: What are the ‘Joshua Graham’s Headwrap’ and ‘Ulysses’ Head and Mask’ recipes?
A: In case you didn’t already know, the DLC characters Joshua Graham and Ulysses don’t have normal faces like normal human NPCs. Instead, their faces are actually high-definition non-playable ‘headwear’ apparel made as an experiment, which is why they never have facial animations. I thought it would be cool to be able to wear them, so I made playable copies of them and crafting recipes for them. Keep in mind that I haven’t tested them out, so weird stuff may happen with them.
Q: Why are there so many recipes for DLC weapons and apparel?
A:  I figured some people don’t like doing certain DLCs but have them anyway and like the equipment that comes with it, so I made a reasonable way to get the equipment without actually doing the DLC.
Q: What does ‘required’ mean in your crafting recipe list below?
A: If an object is ‘required’ in one of my crafting recipes, it means that you need the item to complete the recipe, but you get it back after crafting.
Q: Some recipes require schematics, where do I find them?
A: They are found strewn throughout the wasteland in realistic places, never sold by vendors or in containers. There is only one of each schematic for every recipe, so be sure not to lose them. Unfortunately, I did not and will not release a cheat sheet detailing where each schematic is, if you really want to find out, do the following:
1. Open the GECK (if you do not have it, get it).
2. Click File--&gt;Data.
3. Make sure FNV.esm and FNVCI.esp are check off, then click ‘OK’.
4. In the Object Window of the GECK, click ‘Items’then ‘Misc Items’.
5. All miscellaneous items should now show up in the object window. Miscellaneous items added by me, including schematics, should have the prefix ‘C01’ in their editor ID.
6. Rightclick on the editor ID of whatever schematic you want to find the location of, then click ‘Use Info’.
7. In the new window that pops up, doubleclick what shows up under ‘Used in these Cells’.
8. In the Render Window of the GECK, you should now be able to see the location of the schematic and the cell that the schematic is in  in the Cell View Window.
Q: Will you be releasing any updates, additions or patches for this mod?
A: Depending on how many downloads and endorsements this mod, I may add new recipes into this mod. I have a few ideas for things I could add.
Q: This mod requires all four main DLCs and I don’t have them, is there any solution to this?
A: There is if you know your way around the GECK and FNVedit. Otherwise, sorry. I made the mod with all four DLCs because I figured most people already have them. If you don’t have them and are into FNV, I strongly recommend buying each and every one of them.
Q: Will you be making other mods?
A: This is my first mod ever, and I enjoyed making it, so I plan on making other, albeit different, mods.
Q: Do you recommend this mod with other mods?
A: I recommend this mod with other crafting mods, mainly just because I like crafting.
Q: Why did you make this mod?
A: I wanted to get into modding, felt Nexus lacked full crafting mods, and a crafting mod seemed an easy way to start.

          <short_desc>FNV Vanilla hat fix with all storyline DLCs.esp</short_desc>
          <long_desc isprivate="0">
            <thetext>http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=44319
This file is now included in New Vegas Error corrections and bug fixes: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44204. But will continue to be offered seperately as well as within the aforementioned pack.
1.0  Should be complete now. All headgear glasses and masks should work according to what I felt was a logical approach based on model.   Note the Space helmet is accounted as a nose object as I could not find a suitable slot for it.
Also note this does not fix clipping issues as previously discussed, as frankly I do not have mesh skills as yet.  When my Riverside project is far enough along I will use this mod and an attempt to fix the mesh suggestion as my trial run however.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been editing the stock, and modded headgear I\&apos;ve used in FO3 and FO:NV so that it is compatible with any number of custom hair style mods you will find on here.  Now after a fresh install and hard drive wipe I figured this time when I remake it I will upload it.
One for use by others who would like to add a since of style, or decent hat usage to their already stylish characters. 
Two so I wont have to remake it every damn time I reformat my hard drive.
Now this is not just a hat fixer. It will fix all vanilla head gear (hats, headbands, helmets.) To allow not only custom hair styles to show on those with room for it, but to allow use for eye-wear and masks where possible. 
This one currently only touchs the stock Fallout New Vegas game, it should be loaded after any armor or clothing mods to prevent the retagging of items being over written by another mod.  Some items, such as the Recon armor helmet are tagged to allow custom hair for those with a bangs(sp) fetish to enjoy a nicely framed face without loosing the extra protection.
If you have any suggestions for retagging of those items I have done or have yet to touch please feel free to leave a polite comment.
As this is my first mod upload I hope you all enjoy it, I know I do.
Things to come:  Completeion of the FNV Hat fix in all forms. Any headgear that covers the eye area will eventually be given four-eyes support.  Have not decided if I will add water breathing to all resperator/rebreather type masks and helms as its a bit of a stretch to think every one of them is designed for water use.  Its mostly as a way to keep from breaking game play by having to switch out your gear for your swimming set.
Random additional comments and information:
 Also keep in mind that hats are not marked with the headband slot, one to reduce confliction with hair styles, and two, because you can infact wear a bandana under/over a hat without it taking up to much space for the hat to fit in reallity.
Enjoy
-That @#&amp;-hole Minngarm.
-Temporary change log:  Added four-eyes support for most eye covering head gear.  have not adapted power armor helms as yet. The basics of each DLC are done, still getting down with the coding to add four-eyes support ontop of other \&quot;custom\&quot; enchantments on head gear such as the advanced riot armor helm so bear with me while I work my way through this.</thetext>

\&quot;A World Of Pain\&quot; by David LeMaistre aka Dj Mystro
AWOP REQUIRES THE LATEST FNV PATCH to be installed.
Description:
Adds 114 intense locations to the wasteland filled with enemies and loot. They vary from small Gas Stations to huge maze-like sewers and derelict factories. Adds several days of new gameplay possibilities. A massive new linked Underground complex awaits filled with quests, NPCs with dialogue, vendors and some of the toughest enemies you will encounter anywhere in the game. Also adds many modified weapons, armors and items to the game with enhanced stats to help and hinder you throughout. 
Everything has been done using vanilla content at this stage so the filsesize should still be tiny. That said everything is complete and navmeshed and there should be no gaps or unfinished interiors.
The final version will not have a name change (I changed my mind about that) so it’s gonna be called a Preview forever.
Note about Loot: This mod adds quite a lot of loot (though much less than older versions). If you don\&apos;t like finding lots of useful stuff in most AWOP locations then get the Low Loot patches from the patches site. 
Also if you are concerned that having about 300 extra NPCs in the wasteland will slow your computer down too much grab the LowNPCs Patch (also on the AWOP Patches Site) which removes all but about 15 AWOP NPCs (from exteriors only and removes no-one important or with dialogue).
AWOP Patches Site:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40950
AWOP 4 Dead Money Updated!
-2 new interiors (linked)
-Approx 20 new Vendor Codes (for various ammos, drugs, Nuka Colas and other stuff) spread through the new locations.
-A sort of end to the mods original plot.
-A seperate patch for adding DM Vending Machines to AWOP areas.
AWOP VERSION 5.0 Overhaul Released!
[NOTE: All PATCHES need updating to match the new AWOP standards. They have all been updated too and trying to run some of the older versions will most likely lead to problems]. 
-All areas have improved lighting.
I found how to reduce the fog without losing too much darkness and have been systematically altering every location\&apos;s base light &amp; fog in order to better suit their size, location and shape. 
-Old areas revamped. 
I have been through each area alphabetically, cluttering each location to the same standard. Many extensions have also been built to smaller or previously less unique areas.
-Tons of loot reduced, altered, moved, hidden and stuffed into locked cabinets. 
Instead of 40 5.56mm expect to find clusters of 2-16 rounds in most ammo clusters but look around carefully enough and you should find some more hidden, more reloading supplies or something else to use instead.
-New Notes.
Every listed area has at least one note explaining something about what happened there (thought there are still a few limited exceptions in the Underground and in small houses). Many areas now have several notes (though they can often be hard to find). Finding certain terminal logs will also add specific AWOP Map Markers.
-New Quests.
4 new Quests added:
1: Find Baxter for Sgt Arkus.
2: Help either Legionary Burr or Frost kill the other in Canyon Station.
3: Help a mini-revolution by speaking with Marshal at Cottonwood Bunker.
4: Kill the ghouls east of Novac and find out what happened there for Reed.
-‘M’ Weapon Overhaul:
Significantly increased M Weapon Strength and Skill requirements so they are harder to use at early levels.
-New Music &amp; Ambience settings:
All big areas (and most of the others too) now have appropriate audio settings and music.
-New dialogue.
Find out about local AWOP locations through NPCs such as Rogan and Reed, one new Legion vendor and loads more quest related dialogue.
-Tiered Frankie’s weapon selection to spawn better weapons at higher levels.
-Replaced a load of Static crates in Spring Mount Visitors with more easily movable Empty Sunset Sass Crates.
-New Armors.
-For a full list of new alterations made to AWOP\&apos;s interiors check out the last part of the FAQ near the end of this page.
A WORLD OF PAIN 4 DEAD MONEY:
Adds several new locations to the Sierra Madre in Dead Money. The new locations are some of the most detailed and unique that I have attempted so far and loot is very scarce. Ammo drops are mostly in bundles of 2-8 rounds and you\&apos;ll need to use the reloading bench a lot and scavenge from every corner to get through the new encounters.
Also added are several new notes, recipes and healing items. 
[SEE BELOW \&quot;LOCATIONS ADDED\&quot; FOR MORE INFO]
INSTALLATION:
Drag AWorldOfPain(Preview).esm to the Fallout NV data folder. Select from the data menu on startup or use FOMM in the same manner. Launch game &amp; enjoy.
[WARNING 01: NEXUS MOD MANAGER Auto-Install function does not seem to work properly with this mod. Use the manual drag &amp; drop process outlined above].
[WARNING 02: AWOP adds a huge amount of content to the vanilla game. For this reason it is best played from a new game to avoid corrupting saved game data by creating large discrepencies in the back load data].
REQUIREMENTS:
None apart from one change to the Fallout_default.ini file in order to display the NPCs faces correctly.
Open the file \&apos;Fallout_default.ini\&apos; which should be found in the Steam/SteamApps/Common/FalloutNV folder. Search for the line:
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0
and change it to
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1
Without this all NPCs faces appear in default skin colour. Apart from this there are no requirements and the mod should run anyway. Make a backup if you are uncomfortable editing the file.
There is another version of the Fallout.ini file in the Saved game folder directory (usually in My Documents/My Games). The first one should overwrite this one but if not
changing both should do the trick.
THE BUG:
There is one remaining bug in AWOP FNV that I discovered a little too late to do anything about. It\&apos;s innocuous on it\&apos;s own but couple it with a mod with the same bug and it\&apos;s a CTD-inducer. It only happens in the North Cistern (around the Strip) so it\&apos;s not a big loss either way. The easiest process for fixing it is to run a \&quot;Identical to Master\&quot; filter in FNVEdit and delete AWOP\&apos;s reference to the Cistern from the cell menu.
For the sake of refernece any major recurring slowdown or CTDs induced after installing AWOP are the result of mod conflicts or the saved games (quick &amp; auto saves especially) trying to adjust to all the new data.
AWOP IS COMPLETD:
Hey everyone,
I\&apos;m sorry to say that I\&apos;ll probably never be updating the AWOP mods again.
It\&apos;s nothing against the Nexus or the games or modding scene in general. I feel I have done all I can with the Fallout games and have burned out on them to such an extent I can\&apos;t even play through my own stuff anymore. My mind is now on other things (happier things I feel) and I do not have the time to maintain these mods or the comments pages anymore.
Thanks for the feedback over the years and sorry if I have been a needlessly harsh gobshyte in the past. It\&apos;s nothing personal. I get frustrated easily for a lot of reasons and tend to fire off in all directions but there\&apos;s not time to go into that here.
All the best to everyone that has helped out with AWOP, any of my other mods or just enjoyed the experience and felt inclined to let me know (and the modding scene in general of course) :)
I\&apos;ll email Star now and see if she is still interested in making the voice mod. I have about 10-15 voices ready at the moment so it\&apos;s still far from complete but at least if work begins and is released people with have somewehere else to organise their comments for the mod.
If Star is unavailable I\&apos;ll upload the voices to the downloads page as a MISC download option in case anyone want\&apos;s to have a go in the future.
AWOP for FNV is officially a modder\&apos;s Resource (also Psiclones) and can be used for any purpose the Nexus community sees fit.
Feel free to copy out sections if it helps you get started on a mod.
AWOP for FO3 (and my other Fallout 3 project - Waseland Defence) is not a Modder\&apos;s resource. However I do give open permssion for any of my mods to be patched *with a seperate* .esp (or .esm if needed) in any way and for whatever reason (just to be clear duplicate main esm files are fine for the FNV stuff but not the FO3 stuff). Feel free to upload any patches without asking me for permission.
Duplicating the existing AWOP patches is fine as they are already patches though you will probably have to re-gain the permission of the original authors as well to avoid breaking any rules for uploading to the Nexus.
BOE (and it\&apos;s patches) will most likely not be returning to the Nexus. As far as I\&apos;m aware it can be found easily enough through Google searches. Unfortunately Earache has too decided to call it a day and no longer intends to update any assets claimed as stolen. I can\&apos;t blame him and wish him all the best.
If anyone want\&apos;s to be granted access to update the FNV main pages let me know why and what you have in mind and I can grant you access to page edits (though the response may take a long time).
Have fun and good luck out there all :) 
PS: Here\&apos;s my YouTube link if you\&apos;re interested in seeing what I\&apos;m getting upto in the future:

NOTE ABOUT PATCHES and SAVED GAMES:
Weapon, CalX &amp; Monster Patches all effect varoius containers and NPCs affected by other recent changes. Running those patches will bring back certain NPCs Armor and weapons. I have no plans to change this unless I identify a problem (In those patches more stuff is not a bad thing - lots to buy and lots to kill).
Saved games are affected in a similar way.

AWOP High Quality Song Pack relaesed:
22 original new songs made by myself (mostly) for the Freetech Radio Station (WIP).
DJ MYSTRO MIXSETS:
I have a large collection of very well-mixed and tracklisted mixsets that I can send people the links to if they are interested. I cannot link anything from this site due to various understandable copyright policies so if you are interested then message me your email and I\&apos;ll send you all the info you need.
Current mixes include such styles as Breakz, Breakcore, Drum &amp; Bass, Gabber, Happy Hardcore, Old Skool Rave, Electronica, Frenchcore, Speedcore and probably a few others I forgot about.
One mix is entirely made up of tracks by DJs and musicians who I named NPCs in the friendly Underground after (such as The Headbangers are \&apos;The Headbanger\&apos;, \&apos;Drokz\&apos;, \&apos;S**tmat\&apos; and the three members of \&apos;Endymion\&apos; only I used thier real names). So it\&apos;s kind of a best of the best in my opionion coz all the people down there are my biggest musical influences (for the most part).
Most of the mixes are along similar lines to tracks in the High Quality Song Preview Pack in the downloads section so if you like those you\&apos;ll probably like these.

(V3.6) Small bugfix update - Removes unwanted edits to several vanilla interiors including Primm Sherriff\&apos;s Shack.
hairylegs222s AWOP Fixes released. Small file that addresses a few error messages that would otherwise appear when loading AWOP in FNVEdit (AWOP sill works without so do not panic).

VERSION 3 RELEASED [Major Update]
-Many new fixes and an entire gameplay overhaul courtesy of HarderMan:

Small update to provide full compatability for davidallen\&apos;s \&apos;Decision With Regrets\&apos; mod. The southern Jackal camp has been moved to near the Nuclear Test Site Shacks and has been changed to a \&apos;Mad Ghoul Camp\&apos;. The ghouls there are tough but don\&apos;t respawn.
One warning - if you are running these 2 AWOP weapons patches; Ahztek\&apos;s patch or the CFW patch, both spawn Jackals in that area still.
DWR\&apos;s NPcs can handle it though since they are all essential. 
The Readme is unchanged but the FAQ has been updated.
AWOP 1.0 Released!
-‘The Professional’ Form List updated.

-Underground troops removed from near quest Fiends.

-Most Goodsprings and Novac NCR replaced by Wastelanders.
AWOP 0.8 RELAESED:
No new locations (sorry - check out the Monster Patch for those).
-NCRCF Powder Ganger Faction updated (again - for some reason the changes I made last time undid themselves).
-Lost Legion get all their missing gear back.
-Fixed a Novac Hotel Room Crash.
-Joe Cobb’s gang are now a mob of bosses and can wipe out Goodsprings without player intervention (though I have seen the battle play out many ways already).
-New levelled lists for use in the highly recommended ‘Monster Patch’.
RECOMMENDED MODS:
AWOP has been designed to be the base of a much larger project that I will never have the time to complete. To fill out the AWOP experience I would highly recommend the following mods which do a lot of the work I cannot better that I would have done:
IWS (Increased Wasteland Spawns): Loads more enemies and lots of options.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38623
VVV (Very Voracious Vermin): Like MMM if not much better.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41172
Monster Mod: Loads of new very cool and tough monsters. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41361
Hardened aka Harder Than You: Makes most enemies (especially creatures) much tougher with unique attacks.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=43253
My Radio (Myradio):
Allows you to play your own MP3s through a new radio station. A good way to play Roach\&apos;s tracks until AWOP has it\&apos;s own station. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36406
More Gunz:
Book of Earache:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41626
Classic Fallout Weapons:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37002
Ahzteks Weapon Overhaul:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37342
Stalker Weapon Pack
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40175
Patches in progress for all these weapon mods.
There are a whole load of other great quest and adventure mods available too but far too many to list here.
BUGS:
Possible bug when reseting this MOD with 4D storage active. Only reported once and I\&apos;ve never seen it myself but if you find you get stuck with too much carryweight (and no active storage) use this console command to deduct the relevant amount from your carryweight:
player.forceav carryweight -325 
or whatever the extra total carryweight is (250/75 etc..).
CONFLICTS:
Changes to the exterior wasteland have been kept to an absolute minimum, mostly to avoid conflicts but also to avoid heavily changing the exterior navmesh which can be very awkward at times. As a result conflicts should be minimal. Goodsprings has been changed slightly so anything that alters certain Goodsprings interiors will conflict. The same with certain Stations, shacks etc... I don\&apos;t think it will crash any games if you play with both mods running but you will only end up in the overriding mods interior.
FAQ:
Q: Is there a map?
A: There are now two detailed maps of The Underground thanks to bwilderbeast. You can check them out on the images section. Other than that there\&apos;s just the location guide.
Q: Are the NPCs voiced?
A: At the moment no NPCs have voice overs. There and over 50 NPCs with dialogue in AWOP and I do not have time to do them all. Check out the help post of info in the \&apos;REQUESTING HELP\&apos; section for more info.
Q: MY NPCS ARE EXPLODING (and armor dissapearing along with main weapons), is this a bug?
A: No, this is not a bug, this is an intentional part opf the AWOP gameplay to avoid too much unbalancing the game with too much loot. These NPCs are referred to as having Destruct on Death (or DOD) implants. See below for ways to configure these DOD NPCs.
Q: Can I turn off/alter The DOD (Destruct On Death) loot scripts?
A: [From HarderMan]  \&quot;Ya, it is optional, but you need to install MCM to use the menu to make it so. There are four options, iirc, one is to plain turn the feature on/off, the other is to turn off the feature that makes it much more difficult to disarm the affected NPCs by crippling their arms(and getting their sweet, sweet loots before they destruct), the third is to have the destructed items removed at 30% health(to prevent the possibility that a massive damage spike causes them to die before their loot is destructed, resulting in a dropped weapon), and the last is to turn on/off the destruction of all loot on death.
Again, you need The Mod Configuration Menu to be able to configure these options, it is available here:

Enjoy, and feel free to PM me with feedback, I\&apos;ll try to stop around here and see how people respond as well.
In case anyone is confused, you do not, repeat DO NOT, need MCM to use the AWOP mod, you only need MCM to adjust the loot destruction features. Default settings have high end weapons destructed on affected npcs, harder disarming of affected npcs, and high end weapon removal at 30%.
Oh, and I plan on creating a separate esp patch that will affect much more of the AWOP NPCs with loot destruction, for myself and for anyone else that wants minimal loot. Normally I like massive loot, but I want my next playthrough to be more challenging, item wise.\&quot;
Q: NOTHING IS SHOWING UP AT ALL FROM AWOP.
A: You need to have Fallout New Vegas updated to the latest version to run AWOP. This is the only reason (other than incorrect installation) for *nothing* to show up.
Q: Any advice on LOAD ORDERS?
A: I\&apos;ll tell you the basics about load orders though I\&apos;m not a specialist with \&apos;em. I just follow these rules:
1: ESM files go first (they have to anyway). It\&apos;s best to see ESMs and ESP as seperate lists requiring thier own attention.
2: FNV at top always followed by DLCS (so mods that use info from these can read it from them/alter it after the master files have loaded first)
3: Priority ESP files that replace a lot of data (Gameplay Overhauls) add a load of stuff or affect a lot of levelled lists (such as Weapon mods) go last so other mods cannot over-write thier changes.
Thats it really. Mods that other mods rely on have to go first and the mods you want to overwrite other things/be dominant go last.
I pretty much just use guesswork beyond that.
Also merged patches help coz if two mods affects a creatues weapon spawns one will overwrite the other without the merged patch (though often still do with one in my experience). 
Q: Can you reduce the loot?
A1: Already done, checkout the AWOP Patches site. There will be a reduced loot version released upon completion of each current main version. 
Q: Where are the quests?
A: Quests are from the following NPCs:
Colonel Hoff, (Power Plant A)
Frankie, (Frankie\&apos;s Guns &amp; Ammo)
Major Cobb, (UG Market)
Riazanov, (UG Apartment Offices)
Roach, (Freetech Boradcast Building Upper)
Sgt McMillan, (Dead Man\&apos;s Pass)
Bulldozer, (Emergency Railyard Station/Collapsed Underpass)
Also two open trade quests from:
Fabrie (Fabrie\&apos;s Shack/Haedbangerz Turf)
Schulze (UG Market)
Q: Do the ememies respawn?
A: Yes, a lot of them do, just not the boss or named characters. Most enemies in \&apos;The Underground\&apos; complex are set to not respawn so once purged you can re-use the tunnels to travel relatively safely. 
Q: Does Frankie\&apos;s inventory respawn?
A: Yes, it does but half of his initial inventory is containted within the store on shelves and such (including a lot of ammo) and these items can only be purchased once. This applies to all the vendors in the Underground too, Salamone in The Underground Armouy for example has aprrox 75% of his stock in the Armory itself and it will not respawn.
Q: Why not give the \&apos;M\&apos; weapons unique names?
A: Personally I prefer the simple \&apos;M\&apos; for two reasons:
1: The weapons are easy to find in the inventory which I find very important when carrying 20+ guns.
2: There are a lot of them about (more than one of each) so to give them personal names would not really make sense in that they are modified versions of existing weaponry as opposed to uniques. 
Q: Why M Weapons at all? Are they there coz the enemies are so tough?
A: No, they are not there because the enemies are tougher in AWOP (this never even occured to me during thier creation). Many vanilla Unique weapons are superior to M Weapons but if I had spread those about as interesting rewards many people would have rightfully complained. So to rectify this I created a new tier of weaponry. Firstly beause the challenge AWOP offers requires interesting rewards but also because I felt that many vanilla weapons were underpowered and did not want to alter any vanilla stats (to avoid conflicts). On top of this I feel it is more immersive for many reasons but mainly after 200 years all the weapons would not still be identical and NPCs cannot make used of modded weapons so fights can become unbalanced in favor of the player.
If you still do not like them as they are they can be removed using one of the Low Loot patches from the patches site or replaced and reskinned by a very cool new firearm set courtesy of Book of Earache and the BOE Patch from the AWOP/BOE Patch site.
Q: I\&apos;m getting crashes on every save or when fast-travelling or on enering locations after a certain point in the game with AWOP installed:
A: Don\&apos;t worry too much, this is not an AWOP issue, more of a discepancy between save games issue (as far as I can tell). A lot of people encounter it far a lot of reasons. For example it happened to me with no mods running whilst changing the difficulty settings a couple of times in game.
Basically you just need to find a save that still works (i.e load a back save from before the issue started), play though the same affected area again and it should work fine. 
There are ways to restore your saves but I\&apos;ve never had the time to look into it personally.
Q: Crashes at The North Cistern?
A: An edit was made, in the \&quot;A world of pain(Preview).esm\&quot; file, pertaining to the North Cistern in Westside. When you enter the cistern, Fallout crashes.
Deleting the record in FNVEdit or similar remedies the crash.
The cell is \&quot;1ECisternA\&quot;. 
[Thanks to FiftyTifty for much of the above advice in post]
It\&apos;s a small area and the only edit of it\&apos;s nature I have found in AWOP.

Q: I have killed Labal, Firetooth and/or Smokey but the quest refuses to update (one often is not marked as dead).
That\&apos;s a strange but not uncommon bug. I can only guess that it is caused by a conflict of some kind. There\&apos;s a few ways to try and tackle this problem.
Open the console in game and type the following:
setstage XX03986b 10
Replace XX with AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
That should move you to the next stage of the quest.
Alternatively in the console select the dead Gecko with the mouse and type:
resurrect
this will bring it back to life so you can kill it again.(use \&apos;kill\&apos; in console to do this quickly) I have been told doing this several times can fix the problem.
Also you can try just playing through the areas again from quest start or later.
If all these fail you most likely have a conflict (if you cannot use console either then this is almost definately the case). Try deselecting mods till everything works properly again.
Q: I killed Bertha but she won\&apos;t show up as dead:
A: Same as above with the geckos only in the console type the following to set the correct quest stage:
setstage XX03986b 30
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
Q: I\&apos;m having trouble with another part of Frankie\&apos;s Quest:
A: You have a few setsatge options to progress Frankies quest
In game open the console and type:
setstage XX03986b 10
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
10 = Just an example in this case. See below for other options:
setstage XX03986b 10 : should be the end of Kill The Geckos
setstage XX03986b 20 : Kill Bertha
setstage XX03986b 30 : Collect Key
setstage XX03986b 40 : Enter The Underground
setstage XX03986b 50 : Quest Complete XP reward.
Hopefully one of those should fix it. 
Q: Problems with ROACH\&apos;s Quest?
A: Here\&apos;s the codes for the discs. Hopefully theres a fix in there somewhere:
XX= Awops Mod Index Number (to find this in game click on something from AWOP, e.g Frankie and take the first two numbers)

Q: Where is *that* key in Spring Mt Visitors Centre?
A: [Spoiler Warning] It�s in the neighbouring underground station. It�s on a dead guy who liked to climb. You�ll need to shoot a bit of him off to get it.
Q: I Still can\&apos;t find that key.
A: [Spoiler Warning] You would be able to see him on the screenshot of the Underground Station if the resolution was much higher.
Q: That was a crap clue, seriously I have spent hours looking for this.
A: It\&apos;s on a corpse - he could have been blown to pieces already by a stray missile. If you are really stuck and can\&apos;t see the guy anywhere use \&apos;tcl\&apos; in the console to get up on top of the station entrance to Bonnie Springs Sewer. That\&apos;s where he should be.

\&quot;A World Of Pain\&quot; by David LeMaistre aka Dj Mystro
AWOP REQUIRES THE LATEST FNV PATCH to be installed.
Description:
Adds 114 intense locations to the wasteland filled with enemies and loot. They vary from small Gas Stations to huge maze-like sewers and derelict factories. Adds several days of new gameplay possibilities. A massive new linked Underground complex awaits filled with quests, NPCs with dialogue, vendors and some of the toughest enemies you will encounter anywhere in the game. Also adds many modified weapons, armors and items to the game with enhanced stats to help and hinder you throughout. 
Everything has been done using vanilla content at this stage so the filsesize should still be tiny. That said everything is complete and navmeshed and there should be no gaps or unfinished interiors.
The final version will not have a name change (I changed my mind about that) so it’s gonna be called a Preview forever.
Note about Loot: This mod adds quite a lot of loot (though much less than older versions). If you don\&apos;t like finding lots of useful stuff in most AWOP locations then get the Low Loot patches from the patches site. 
Also if you are concerned that having about 300 extra NPCs in the wasteland will slow your computer down too much grab the LowNPCs Patch (also on the AWOP Patches Site) which removes all but about 15 AWOP NPCs (from exteriors only and removes no-one important or with dialogue).
AWOP Patches Site:

AWOP 4 Dead Money Updated!
-2 new interiors (linked)
-Approx 20 new Vendor Codes (for various ammos, drugs, Nuka Colas and other stuff) spread through the new locations.
-A sort of end to the mods original plot.
-A seperate patch for adding DM Vending Machines to AWOP areas.
AWOP VERSION 5.0 Overhaul Released!
[NOTE: All PATCHES need updating to match the new AWOP standards. They have all been updated too and trying to run some of the older versions will most likely lead to problems]. 
-All areas have improved lighting.
I found how to reduce the fog without losing too much darkness and have been systematically altering every location\&apos;s base light &amp; fog in order to better suit their size, location and shape. 
-Old areas revamped. 
I have been through each area alphabetically, cluttering each location to the same standard. Many extensions have also been built to smaller or previously less unique areas.
-Tons of loot reduced, altered, moved, hidden and stuffed into locked cabinets. 
Instead of 40 5.56mm expect to find clusters of 2-16 rounds in most ammo clusters but look around carefully enough and you should find some more hidden, more reloading supplies or something else to use instead.
-New Notes.
Every listed area has at least one note explaining something about what happened there (thought there are still a few limited exceptions in the Underground and in small houses). Many areas now have several notes (though they can often be hard to find). Finding certain terminal logs will also add specific AWOP Map Markers.
-New Quests.
4 new Quests added:
1: Find Baxter for Sgt Arkus.
2: Help either Legionary Burr or Frost kill the other in Canyon Station.
3: Help a mini-revolution by speaking with Marshal at Cottonwood Bunker.
4: Kill the ghouls east of Novac and find out what happened there for Reed.
-‘M’ Weapon Overhaul:
Significantly increased M Weapon Strength and Skill requirements so they are harder to use at early levels.
-New Music &amp; Ambience settings:
All big areas (and most of the others too) now have appropriate audio settings and music.
-New dialogue.
Find out about local AWOP locations through NPCs such as Rogan and Reed, one new Legion vendor and loads more quest related dialogue.
-Tiered Frankie’s weapon selection to spawn better weapons at higher levels.
-Replaced a load of Static crates in Spring Mount Visitors with more easily movable Empty Sunset Sass Crates.
-New Armors.
-For a full list of new alterations made to AWOP\&apos;s interiors check out the last part of the FAQ near the end of this page.
A WORLD OF PAIN 4 DEAD MONEY:
Adds several new locations to the Sierra Madre in Dead Money. The new locations are some of the most detailed and unique that I have attempted so far and loot is very scarce. Ammo drops are mostly in bundles of 2-8 rounds and you\&apos;ll need to use the reloading bench a lot and scavenge from every corner to get through the new encounters.
Also added are several new notes, recipes and healing items. 
[SEE BELOW \&quot;LOCATIONS ADDED\&quot; FOR MORE INFO]
INSTALLATION:
Drag AWorldOfPain(Preview).esm to the Fallout NV data folder. Select from the data menu on startup or use FOMM in the same manner. Launch game &amp; enjoy.
[WARNING 01: NEXUS MOD MANAGER Auto-Install function does not seem to work properly with this mod. Use the manual drag &amp; drop process outlined above].
[WARNING 02: AWOP adds a huge amount of content to the vanilla game. For this reason it is best played from a new game to avoid corrupting saved game data by creating large discrepencies in the back load data].
REQUIREMENTS:
None apart from one change to the Fallout_default.ini file in order to display the NPCs faces correctly.
Open the file \&apos;Fallout_default.ini\&apos; which should be found in the Steam/SteamApps/Common/FalloutNV folder. Search for the line:
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0
and change it to
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1
Without this all NPCs faces appear in default skin colour. Apart from this there are no requirements and the mod should run anyway. Make a backup if you are uncomfortable editing the file.
There is another version of the Fallout.ini file in the Saved game folder directory (usually in My Documents/My Games). The first one should overwrite this one but if not
changing both should do the trick.
THE BUG:
There is one remaining bug in AWOP FNV that I discovered a little too late to do anything about. It\&apos;s innocuous on it\&apos;s own but couple it with a mod with the same bug and it\&apos;s a CTD-inducer. It only happens in the North Cistern (around the Strip) so it\&apos;s not a big loss either way. The easiest process for fixing it is to run a \&quot;Identical to Master\&quot; filter in FNVEdit and delete AWOP\&apos;s reference to the Cistern from the cell menu.
For the sake of refernece any major recurring slowdown or CTDs induced after installing AWOP are the result of mod conflicts or the saved games (quick &amp; auto saves especially) trying to adjust to all the new data.
AWOP IS COMPLETD:
Hey everyone,
I\&apos;m sorry to say that I\&apos;ll probably never be updating the AWOP mods again.
It\&apos;s nothing against the Nexus or the games or modding scene in general. I feel I have done all I can with the Fallout games and have burned out on them to such an extent I can\&apos;t even play through my own stuff anymore. My mind is now on other things (happier things I feel) and I do not have the time to maintain these mods or the comments pages anymore.
Thanks for the feedback over the years and sorry if I have been a needlessly harsh gobshyte in the past. It\&apos;s nothing personal. I get frustrated easily for a lot of reasons and tend to fire off in all directions but there\&apos;s not time to go into that here.
All the best to everyone that has helped out with AWOP, any of my other mods or just enjoyed the experience and felt inclined to let me know (and the modding scene in general of course) :)
I\&apos;ll email Star now and see if she is still interested in making the voice mod. I have about 10-15 voices ready at the moment so it\&apos;s still far from complete but at least if work begins and is released people with have somewehere else to organise their comments for the mod.
If Star is unavailable I\&apos;ll upload the voices to the downloads page as a MISC download option in case anyone want\&apos;s to have a go in the future.
AWOP for FNV is officially a modder\&apos;s Resource (also Psiclones) and can be used for any purpose the Nexus community sees fit.
Feel free to copy out sections if it helps you get started on a mod.
AWOP for FO3 (and my other Fallout 3 project - Waseland Defence) is not a Modder\&apos;s resource. However I do give open permssion for any of my mods to be patched *with a seperate* .esp (or .esm if needed) in any way and for whatever reason (just to be clear duplicate main esm files are fine for the FNV stuff but not the FO3 stuff). Feel free to upload any patches without asking me for permission.
Duplicating the existing AWOP patches is fine as they are already patches though you will probably have to re-gain the permission of the original authors as well to avoid breaking any rules for uploading to the Nexus.
BOE (and it\&apos;s patches) will most likely not be returning to the Nexus. As far as I\&apos;m aware it can be found easily enough through Google searches. Unfortunately Earache has too decided to call it a day and no longer intends to update any assets claimed as stolen. I can\&apos;t blame him and wish him all the best.
If anyone want\&apos;s to be granted access to update the FNV main pages let me know why and what you have in mind and I can grant you access to page edits (though the response may take a long time).
Have fun and good luck out there all :)

NOTE ABOUT PATCHES and SAVED GAMES:
Weapon, CalX &amp; Monster Patches all effect varoius containers and NPCs affected by other recent changes. Running those patches will bring back certain NPCs Armor and weapons. I have no plans to change this unless I identify a problem (In those patches more stuff is not a bad thing - lots to buy and lots to kill).
Saved games are affected in a similar way.

AWOP High Quality Song Pack relaesed:
22 original new songs made by myself (mostly) for the Freetech Radio Station (WIP).
DJ MYSTRO MIXSETS:
I have a large collection of very well-mixed and tracklisted mixsets that I can send people the links to if they are interested. I cannot link anything from this site due to various understandable copyright policies so if you are interested then message me your email and I\&apos;ll send you all the info you need.
Current mixes include such styles as Breakz, Breakcore, Drum &amp; Bass, Gabber, Happy Hardcore, Old Skool Rave, Electronica, Frenchcore, Speedcore and probably a few others I forgot about.
One mix is entirely made up of tracks by DJs and musicians who I named NPCs in the friendly Underground after (such as The Headbangers are \&apos;The Headbanger\&apos;, \&apos;Drokz\&apos;, \&apos;S**tmat\&apos; and the three members of \&apos;Endymion\&apos; only I used thier real names). So it\&apos;s kind of a best of the best in my opionion coz all the people down there are my biggest musical influences (for the most part).
Most of the mixes are along similar lines to tracks in the High Quality Song Preview Pack in the downloads section so if you like those you\&apos;ll probably like these.

Small update to provide full compatability for davidallen\&apos;s \&apos;Decision With Regrets\&apos; mod. The southern Jackal camp has been moved to near the Nuclear Test Site Shacks and has been changed to a \&apos;Mad Ghoul Camp\&apos;. The ghouls there are tough but don\&apos;t respawn.
One warning - if you are running these 2 AWOP weapons patches; Ahztek\&apos;s patch or the CFW patch, both spawn Jackals in that area still.
DWR\&apos;s NPcs can handle it though since they are all essential. 
The Readme is unchanged but the FAQ has been updated.

-‘The Professional’ Form List updated.

-Underground troops removed from near quest Fiends.

-Most Goodsprings and Novac NCR replaced by Wastelanders.
AWOP 0.8 RELAESED:
No new locations (sorry - check out the Monster Patch for those).
-NCRCF Powder Ganger Faction updated (again - for some reason the changes I made last time undid themselves).
-Lost Legion get all their missing gear back.
-Fixed a Novac Hotel Room Crash.
-Joe Cobb’s gang are now a mob of bosses and can wipe out Goodsprings without player intervention (though I have seen the battle play out many ways already).
-New levelled lists for use in the highly recommended ‘Monster Patch’.
RECOMMENDED MODS:
AWOP has been designed to be the base of a much larger project that I will never have the time to complete. To fill out the AWOP experience I would highly recommend the following mods which do a lot of the work I cannot better that I would have done:
IWS (Increased Wasteland Spawns): Loads more enemies and lots of options.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38623
VVV (Very Voracious Vermin): Like MMM if not much better.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41172
Monster Mod: Loads of new very cool and tough monsters. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41361
Hardened aka Harder Than You: Makes most enemies (especially creatures) much tougher with unique attacks.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=43253
My Radio (Myradio):
Allows you to play your own MP3s through a new radio station. A good way to play Roach\&apos;s tracks until AWOP has it\&apos;s own station. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36406
More Gunz:
Book of Earache:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41626
Classic Fallout Weapons:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37002
Ahzteks Weapon Overhaul:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37342
Stalker Weapon Pack
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40175
Patches in progress for all these weapon mods.
There are a whole load of other great quest and adventure mods available too but far too many to list here.
BUGS:
Possible bug when reseting this MOD with 4D storage active. Only reported once and I\&apos;ve never seen it myself but if you find you get stuck with too much carryweight (and no active storage) use this console command to deduct the relevant amount from your carryweight:
player.forceav carryweight -325 
or whatever the extra total carryweight is (250/75 etc..).
CONFLICTS:
Changes to the exterior wasteland have been kept to an absolute minimum, mostly to avoid conflicts but also to avoid heavily changing the exterior navmesh which can be very awkward at times. As a result conflicts should be minimal. Goodsprings has been changed slightly so anything that alters certain Goodsprings interiors will conflict. The same with certain Stations, shacks etc... I don\&apos;t think it will crash any games if you play with both mods running but you will only end up in the overriding mods interior.
FAQ:
Q: Is there a map?
A: There are now two detailed maps of The Underground thanks to bwilderbeast. You can check them out on the images section. Other than that there\&apos;s just the location guide.
Q: Are the NPCs voiced?
A: At the moment no NPCs have voice overs. There and over 50 NPCs with dialogue in AWOP and I do not have time to do them all. Check out the help post of info in the \&apos;REQUESTING HELP\&apos; section for more info.
Q: MY NPCS ARE EXPLODING (and armor dissapearing along with main weapons), is this a bug?
A: No, this is not a bug, this is an intentional part opf the AWOP gameplay to avoid too much unbalancing the game with too much loot. These NPCs are referred to as having Destruct on Death (or DOD) implants. See below for ways to configure these DOD NPCs.
Q: Can I turn off/alter The DOD (Destruct On Death) loot scripts?
A: [From HarderMan]  \&quot;Ya, it is optional, but you need to install MCM to use the menu to make it so. There are four options, iirc, one is to plain turn the feature on/off, the other is to turn off the feature that makes it much more difficult to disarm the affected NPCs by crippling their arms(and getting their sweet, sweet loots before they destruct), the third is to have the destructed items removed at 30% health(to prevent the possibility that a massive damage spike causes them to die before their loot is destructed, resulting in a dropped weapon), and the last is to turn on/off the destruction of all loot on death.
Again, you need The Mod Configuration Menu to be able to configure these options, it is available here:
http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42507
Enjoy, and feel free to PM me with feedback, I\&apos;ll try to stop around here and see how people respond as well.
In case anyone is confused, you do not, repeat DO NOT, need MCM to use the AWOP mod, you only need MCM to adjust the loot destruction features. Default settings have high end weapons destructed on affected npcs, harder disarming of affected npcs, and high end weapon removal at 30%.
Oh, and I plan on creating a separate esp patch that will affect much more of the AWOP NPCs with loot destruction, for myself and for anyone else that wants minimal loot. Normally I like massive loot, but I want my next playthrough to be more challenging, item wise.\&quot;
Q: NOTHING IS SHOWING UP AT ALL FROM AWOP.
A: You need to have Fallout New Vegas updated to the latest version to run AWOP. This is the only reason (other than incorrect installation) for *nothing* to show up.
Q: Any advice on LOAD ORDERS?
A: I\&apos;ll tell you the basics about load orders though I\&apos;m not a specialist with \&apos;em. I just follow these rules:
1: ESM files go first (they have to anyway). It\&apos;s best to see ESMs and ESP as seperate lists requiring thier own attention.
2: FNV at top always followed by DLCS (so mods that use info from these can read it from them/alter it after the master files have loaded first)
3: Priority ESP files that replace a lot of data (Gameplay Overhauls) add a load of stuff or affect a lot of levelled lists (such as Weapon mods) go last so other mods cannot over-write thier changes.
Thats it really. Mods that other mods rely on have to go first and the mods you want to overwrite other things/be dominant go last.
I pretty much just use guesswork beyond that.
Also merged patches help coz if two mods affects a creatues weapon spawns one will overwrite the other without the merged patch (though often still do with one in my experience). 
Q: Can you reduce the loot?
A1: Already done, checkout the AWOP Patches site. There will be a reduced loot version released upon completion of each current main version. 
Q: Where are the quests?
A: Quests are from the following NPCs:
Colonel Hoff, (Power Plant A)
Frankie, (Frankie\&apos;s Guns &amp; Ammo)
Major Cobb, (UG Market)
Riazanov, (UG Apartment Offices)
Roach, (Freetech Boradcast Building Upper)
Sgt McMillan, (Dead Man\&apos;s Pass)
Bulldozer, (Emergency Railyard Station/Collapsed Underpass)
Also two open trade quests from:
Fabrie (Fabrie\&apos;s Shack/Haedbangerz Turf)
Schulze (UG Market)
Q: Do the ememies respawn?
A: Yes, a lot of them do, just not the boss or named characters. Most enemies in \&apos;The Underground\&apos; complex are set to not respawn so once purged you can re-use the tunnels to travel relatively safely. 
Q: Does Frankie\&apos;s inventory respawn?
A: Yes, it does but half of his initial inventory is containted within the store on shelves and such (including a lot of ammo) and these items can only be purchased once. This applies to all the vendors in the Underground too, Salamone in The Underground Armouy for example has aprrox 75% of his stock in the Armory itself and it will not respawn.
Q: Why not give the \&apos;M\&apos; weapons unique names?
A: Personally I prefer the simple \&apos;M\&apos; for two reasons:
1: The weapons are easy to find in the inventory which I find very important when carrying 20+ guns.
2: There are a lot of them about (more than one of each) so to give them personal names would not really make sense in that they are modified versions of existing weaponry as opposed to uniques. 
Q: Why M Weapons at all? Are they there coz the enemies are so tough?
A: No, they are not there because the enemies are tougher in AWOP (this never even occured to me during thier creation). Many vanilla Unique weapons are superior to M Weapons but if I had spread those about as interesting rewards many people would have rightfully complained. So to rectify this I created a new tier of weaponry. Firstly beause the challenge AWOP offers requires interesting rewards but also because I felt that many vanilla weapons were underpowered and did not want to alter any vanilla stats (to avoid conflicts). On top of this I feel it is more immersive for many reasons but mainly after 200 years all the weapons would not still be identical and NPCs cannot make used of modded weapons so fights can become unbalanced in favor of the player.
If you still do not like them as they are they can be removed using one of the Low Loot patches from the patches site or replaced and reskinned by a very cool new firearm set courtesy of Book of Earache and the BOE Patch from the AWOP/BOE Patch site.
Q: I\&apos;m getting crashes on every save or when fast-travelling or on enering locations after a certain point in the game with AWOP installed:
A: Don\&apos;t worry too much, this is not an AWOP issue, more of a discepancy between save games issue (as far as I can tell). A lot of people encounter it far a lot of reasons. For example it happened to me with no mods running whilst changing the difficulty settings a couple of times in game.
Basically you just need to find a save that still works (i.e load a back save from before the issue started), play though the same affected area again and it should work fine. 
There are ways to restore your saves but I\&apos;ve never had the time to look into it personally.
Q: Crashes at The North Cistern?
A: An edit was made, in the \&quot;A world of pain(Preview).esm\&quot; file, pertaining to the North Cistern in Westside. When you enter the cistern, Fallout crashes.
Deleting the record in FNVEdit or similar remedies the crash.
The cell is \&quot;1ECisternA\&quot;. 
[Thanks to FiftyTifty for much of the above advice in post]
It\&apos;s a small area and the only edit of it\&apos;s nature I have found in AWOP.

Q: I have killed Labal, Firetooth and/or Smokey but the quest refuses to update (one often is not marked as dead).
That\&apos;s a strange but not uncommon bug. I can only guess that it is caused by a conflict of some kind. There\&apos;s a few ways to try and tackle this problem.
Open the console in game and type the following:
setstage XX03986b 10
Replace XX with AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
That should move you to the next stage of the quest.
Alternatively in the console select the dead Gecko with the mouse and type:
resurrect
this will bring it back to life so you can kill it again.(use \&apos;kill\&apos; in console to do this quickly) I have been told doing this several times can fix the problem.
Also you can try just playing through the areas again from quest start or later.
If all these fail you most likely have a conflict (if you cannot use console either then this is almost definately the case). Try deselecting mods till everything works properly again.
Q: I killed Bertha but she won\&apos;t show up as dead:
A: Same as above with the geckos only in the console type the following to set the correct quest stage:
setstage XX03986b 30
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
Q: I\&apos;m having trouble with another part of Frankie\&apos;s Quest:
A: You have a few setsatge options to progress Frankies quest
In game open the console and type:
setstage XX03986b 10
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
10 = Just an example in this case. See below for other options:
setstage XX03986b 10 : should be the end of Kill The Geckos
setstage XX03986b 20 : Kill Bertha
setstage XX03986b 30 : Collect Key
setstage XX03986b 40 : Enter The Underground
setstage XX03986b 50 : Quest Complete XP reward.
Hopefully one of those should fix it. 
Q: Problems with ROACH\&apos;s Quest?
A: Here\&apos;s the codes for the discs. Hopefully theres a fix in there somewhere:
XX= Awops Mod Index Number (to find this in game click on something from AWOP, e.g Frankie and take the first two numbers)

Q: Where is *that* key in Spring Mt Visitors Centre?
A: [Spoiler Warning] It�s in the neighbouring underground station. It�s on a dead guy who liked to climb. You�ll need to shoot a bit of him off to get it.
Q: I Still can\&apos;t find that key.
A: [Spoiler Warning] You would be able to see him on the screenshot of the Underground Station if the resolution was much higher.
Q: That was a crap clue, seriously I have spent hours looking for this.
A: It\&apos;s on a corpse - he could have been blown to pieces already by a stray missile. If you are really stuck and can\&apos;t see the guy anywhere use \&apos;tcl\&apos; in the console to get up on top of the station entrance to Bonnie Springs Sewer. That\&apos;s where he should be.

\&quot;A World Of Pain\&quot; by David LeMaistre aka Dj Mystro
AWOP REQUIRES THE LATEST FNV PATCH to be installed.
Description:
Adds 114 intense locations to the wasteland filled with enemies and loot. They vary from small Gas Stations to huge maze-like sewers and derelict factories. Adds several days of new gameplay possibilities. A massive new linked Underground complex awaits filled with quests, NPCs with dialogue, vendors and some of the toughest enemies you will encounter anywhere in the game. Also adds many modified weapons, armors and items to the game with enhanced stats to help and hinder you throughout. 
Everything has been done using vanilla content at this stage so the filsesize should still be tiny. That said everything is complete and navmeshed and there should be no gaps or unfinished interiors.
The final version will not have a name change (I changed my mind about that) so it’s gonna be called a Preview forever.
Note about Loot: This mod adds quite a lot of loot (though much less than older versions). If you don\&apos;t like finding lots of useful stuff in most AWOP locations then get the Low Loot patches from the patches site. 
Also if you are concerned that having about 300 extra NPCs in the wasteland will slow your computer down too much grab the LowNPCs Patch (also on the AWOP Patches Site) which removes all but about 15 AWOP NPCs (from exteriors only and removes no-one important or with dialogue).
AWOP Patches Site:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40950
AWOP 4 Dead Money Updated!
-2 new interiors (linked)
-Approx 20 new Vendor Codes (for various ammos, drugs, Nuka Colas and other stuff) spread through the new locations.
-A sort of end to the mods original plot.
-A seperate patch for adding DM Vending Machines to AWOP areas.
AWOP VERSION 5.0 Overhaul Released!
[NOTE: All PATCHES need updating to match the new AWOP standards. They have all been updated too and trying to run some of the older versions will most likely lead to problems]. 
-All areas have improved lighting.
I found how to reduce the fog without losing too much darkness and have been systematically altering every location\&apos;s base light &amp; fog in order to better suit their size, location and shape. 
-Old areas revamped. 
I have been through each area alphabetically, cluttering each location to the same standard. Many extensions have also been built to smaller or previously less unique areas.
-Tons of loot reduced, altered, moved, hidden and stuffed into locked cabinets. 
Instead of 40 5.56mm expect to find clusters of 2-16 rounds in most ammo clusters but look around carefully enough and you should find some more hidden, more reloading supplies or something else to use instead.
-New Notes.
Every listed area has at least one note explaining something about what happened there (thought there are still a few limited exceptions in the Underground and in small houses). Many areas now have several notes (though they can often be hard to find). Finding certain terminal logs will also add specific AWOP Map Markers.
-New Quests.
4 new Quests added:
1: Find Baxter for Sgt Arkus.
2: Help either Legionary Burr or Frost kill the other in Canyon Station.
3: Help a mini-revolution by speaking with Marshal at Cottonwood Bunker.
4: Kill the ghouls east of Novac and find out what happened there for Reed.
-‘M’ Weapon Overhaul:
Significantly increased M Weapon Strength and Skill requirements so they are harder to use at early levels.
-New Music &amp; Ambience settings:
All big areas (and most of the others too) now have appropriate audio settings and music.
-New dialogue.
Find out about local AWOP locations through NPCs such as Rogan and Reed, one new Legion vendor and loads more quest related dialogue.
-Tiered Frankie’s weapon selection to spawn better weapons at higher levels.
-Replaced a load of Static crates in Spring Mount Visitors with more easily movable Empty Sunset Sass Crates.
-New Armors.
-For a full list of new alterations made to AWOP\&apos;s interiors check out the last part of the FAQ near the end of this page.
A WORLD OF PAIN 4 DEAD MONEY:
Adds several new locations to the Sierra Madre in Dead Money. The new locations are some of the most detailed and unique that I have attempted so far and loot is very scarce. Ammo drops are mostly in bundles of 2-8 rounds and you\&apos;ll need to use the reloading bench a lot and scavenge from every corner to get through the new encounters.
Also added are several new notes, recipes and healing items. 
[SEE BELOW \&quot;LOCATIONS ADDED\&quot; FOR MORE INFO]
INSTALLATION:
Drag AWorldOfPain(Preview).esm to the Fallout NV data folder. Select from the data menu on startup or use FOMM in the same manner. Launch game &amp; enjoy.
[WARNING 01: NEXUS MOD MANAGER Auto-Install function does not seem to work properly with this mod. Use the manual drag &amp; drop process outlined above].
[WARNING 02: AWOP adds a huge amount of content to the vanilla game. For this reason it is best played from a new game to avoid corrupting saved game data by creating large discrepencies in the back load data].
REQUIREMENTS:
None apart from one change to the Fallout_default.ini file in order to display the NPCs faces correctly.
Open the file \&apos;Fallout_default.ini\&apos; which should be found in the Steam/SteamApps/Common/FalloutNV folder. Search for the line:
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0
and change it to
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1
Without this all NPCs faces appear in default skin colour. Apart from this there are no requirements and the mod should run anyway. Make a backup if you are uncomfortable editing the file.
There is another version of the Fallout.ini file in the Saved game folder directory (usually in My Documents/My Games). The first one should overwrite this one but if not
changing both should do the trick.
THE BUG:
There is one remaining bug in AWOP FNV that I discovered a little too late to do anything about. It\&apos;s innocuous on it\&apos;s own but couple it with a mod with the same bug and it\&apos;s a CTD-inducer. It only happens in the North Cistern (around the Strip) so it\&apos;s not a big loss either way. The easiest process for fixing it is to run a \&quot;Identical to Master\&quot; filter in FNVEdit and delete AWOP\&apos;s reference to the Cistern from the cell menu.
For the sake of refernece any major recurring slowdown or CTDs induced after installing AWOP are the result of mod conflicts or the saved games (quick &amp; auto saves especially) trying to adjust to all the new data.
AWOP IS COMPLETD:
Hey everyone,
I\&apos;m sorry to say that I\&apos;ll probably never be updating the AWOP mods again.
It\&apos;s nothing against the Nexus or the games or modding scene in general. I feel I have done all I can with the Fallout games and have burned out on them to such an extent I can\&apos;t even play through my own stuff anymore. My mind is now on other things (happier things I feel) and I do not have the time to maintain these mods or the comments pages anymore.
Thanks for the feedback over the years and sorry if I have been a needlessly harsh gobshyte in the past. It\&apos;s nothing personal. I get frustrated easily for a lot of reasons and tend to fire off in all directions but there\&apos;s not time to go into that here.
All the best to everyone that has helped out with AWOP, any of my other mods or just enjoyed the experience and felt inclined to let me know (and the modding scene in general of course) :)
I\&apos;ll email Star now and see if she is still interested in making the voice mod. I have about 10-15 voices ready at the moment so it\&apos;s still far from complete but at least if work begins and is released people with have somewehere else to organise their comments for the mod.
If Star is unavailable I\&apos;ll upload the voices to the downloads page as a MISC download option in case anyone want\&apos;s to have a go in the future.
AWOP for FNV is officially a modder\&apos;s Resource (also Psiclones) and can be used for any purpose the Nexus community sees fit.
Feel free to copy out sections if it helps you get started on a mod.
AWOP for FO3 (and my other Fallout 3 project - Waseland Defence) is not a Modder\&apos;s resource. However I do give open permssion for any of my mods to be patched *with a seperate* .esp (or .esm if needed) in any way and for whatever reason (just to be clear duplicate main esm files are fine for the FNV stuff but not the FO3 stuff). Feel free to upload any patches without asking me for permission.
Duplicating the existing AWOP patches is fine as they are already patches though you will probably have to re-gain the permission of the original authors as well to avoid breaking any rules for uploading to the Nexus.
BOE (and it\&apos;s patches) will most likely not be returning to the Nexus. As far as I\&apos;m aware it can be found easily enough through Google searches. Unfortunately Earache has too decided to call it a day and no longer intends to update any assets claimed as stolen. I can\&apos;t blame him and wish him all the best.
If anyone want\&apos;s to be granted access to update the FNV main pages let me know why and what you have in mind and I can grant you access to page edits (though the response may take a long time).
Have fun and good luck out there all :) 
PS: Here\&apos;s my YouTube link if you\&apos;re interested in seeing what I\&apos;m getting upto in the future:

NOTE ABOUT PATCHES and SAVED GAMES:
Weapon, CalX &amp; Monster Patches all effect varoius containers and NPCs affected by other recent changes. Running those patches will bring back certain NPCs Armor and weapons. I have no plans to change this unless I identify a problem (In those patches more stuff is not a bad thing - lots to buy and lots to kill).
Saved games are affected in a similar way.

AWOP High Quality Song Pack relaesed:
22 original new songs made by myself (mostly) for the Freetech Radio Station (WIP).
DJ MYSTRO MIXSETS:
I have a large collection of very well-mixed and tracklisted mixsets that I can send people the links to if they are interested. I cannot link anything from this site due to various understandable copyright policies so if you are interested then message me your email and I\&apos;ll send you all the info you need.
Current mixes include such styles as Breakz, Breakcore, Drum &amp; Bass, Gabber, Happy Hardcore, Old Skool Rave, Electronica, Frenchcore, Speedcore and probably a few others I forgot about.
One mix is entirely made up of tracks by DJs and musicians who I named NPCs in the friendly Underground after (such as The Headbangers are \&apos;The Headbanger\&apos;, \&apos;Drokz\&apos;, \&apos;S**tmat\&apos; and the three members of \&apos;Endymion\&apos; only I used thier real names). So it\&apos;s kind of a best of the best in my opionion coz all the people down there are my biggest musical influences (for the most part).
Most of the mixes are along similar lines to tracks in the High Quality Song Preview Pack in the downloads section so if you like those you\&apos;ll probably like these.

(V3.6) Small bugfix update - Removes unwanted edits to several vanilla interiors including Primm Sherriff\&apos;s Shack.
hairylegs222s AWOP Fixes released. Small file that addresses a few error messages that would otherwise appear when loading AWOP in FNVEdit (AWOP sill works without so do not panic).

-Added stashes of reloading bench supplies to several areas.
VERSION 3 RELEASED [Major Update]
-Many new fixes and an entire gameplay overhaul courtesy of HarderMan:

--Roach’s Quest repaired – Quest markers and objectives now update properly.

Small update to provide full compatability for davidallen\&apos;s \&apos;Decision With Regrets\&apos; mod. The southern Jackal camp has been moved to near the Nuclear Test Site Shacks and has been changed to a \&apos;Mad Ghoul Camp\&apos;. The ghouls there are tough but don\&apos;t respawn.
One warning - if you are running these 2 AWOP weapons patches; Ahztek\&apos;s patch or the CFW patch, both spawn Jackals in that area still.
DWR\&apos;s NPcs can handle it though since they are all essential. 
The Readme is unchanged but the FAQ has been updated.
AWOP 1.0 Released!
-‘The Professional’ Form List updated.
-New unlootable Armor for the 5 main Goodsprings NPCs.
-Underground troops removed from near quest Fiends.

-Most Goodsprings and Novac NCR replaced by Wastelanders.
AWOP 0.8 RELAESED:
No new locations (sorry - check out the Monster Patch for those).
-NCRCF Powder Ganger Faction updated (again - for some reason the changes I made last time undid themselves).
-Lost Legion get all their missing gear back.
-Fixed a Novac Hotel Room Crash.
-Joe Cobb’s gang are now a mob of bosses and can wipe out Goodsprings without player intervention (though I have seen the battle play out many ways already).
-New levelled lists for use in the highly recommended ‘Monster Patch’.
RECOMMENDED MODS:
AWOP has been designed to be the base of a much larger project that I will never have the time to complete. To fill out the AWOP experience I would highly recommend the following mods which do a lot of the work I cannot better that I would have done:
IWS (Increased Wasteland Spawns): Loads more enemies and lots of options.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38623
VVV (Very Voracious Vermin): Like MMM if not much better.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41172
Monster Mod: Loads of new very cool and tough monsters. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41361
Hardened aka Harder Than You: Makes most enemies (especially creatures) much tougher with unique attacks.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=43253
My Radio (Myradio):
Allows you to play your own MP3s through a new radio station. A good way to play Roach\&apos;s tracks until AWOP has it\&apos;s own station.

Patches in progress for all these weapon mods.
There are a whole load of other great quest and adventure mods available too but far too many to list here.
BUGS:
Possible bug when reseting this MOD with 4D storage active. Only reported once and I\&apos;ve never seen it myself but if you find you get stuck with too much carryweight (and no active storage) use this console command to deduct the relevant amount from your carryweight:
player.forceav carryweight -325 
or whatever the extra total carryweight is (250/75 etc..).
CONFLICTS:
Changes to the exterior wasteland have been kept to an absolute minimum, mostly to avoid conflicts but also to avoid heavily changing the exterior navmesh which can be very awkward at times. As a result conflicts should be minimal. Goodsprings has been changed slightly so anything that alters certain Goodsprings interiors will conflict. The same with certain Stations, shacks etc... I don\&apos;t think it will crash any games if you play with both mods running but you will only end up in the overriding mods interior.
FAQ:
Q: Is there a map?
A: There are now two detailed maps of The Underground thanks to bwilderbeast. You can check them out on the images section. Other than that there\&apos;s just the location guide.
Q: Are the NPCs voiced?
A: At the moment no NPCs have voice overs. There and over 50 NPCs with dialogue in AWOP and I do not have time to do them all. Check out the help post of info in the \&apos;REQUESTING HELP\&apos; section for more info.
Q: MY NPCS ARE EXPLODING (and armor dissapearing along with main weapons), is this a bug?
A: No, this is not a bug, this is an intentional part opf the AWOP gameplay to avoid too much unbalancing the game with too much loot. These NPCs are referred to as having Destruct on Death (or DOD) implants. See below for ways to configure these DOD NPCs.
Q: Can I turn off/alter The DOD (Destruct On Death) loot scripts?
A: [From HarderMan]  \&quot;Ya, it is optional, but you need to install MCM to use the menu to make it so. There are four options, iirc, one is to plain turn the feature on/off, the other is to turn off the feature that makes it much more difficult to disarm the affected NPCs by crippling their arms(and getting their sweet, sweet loots before they destruct), the third is to have the destructed items removed at 30% health(to prevent the possibility that a massive damage spike causes them to die before their loot is destructed, resulting in a dropped weapon), and the last is to turn on/off the destruction of all loot on death.
Again, you need The Mod Configuration Menu to be able to configure these options, it is available here:
http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42507
Enjoy, and feel free to PM me with feedback, I\&apos;ll try to stop around here and see how people respond as well.
In case anyone is confused, you do not, repeat DO NOT, need MCM to use the AWOP mod, you only need MCM to adjust the loot destruction features. Default settings have high end weapons destructed on affected npcs, harder disarming of affected npcs, and high end weapon removal at 30%.
Oh, and I plan on creating a separate esp patch that will affect much more of the AWOP NPCs with loot destruction, for myself and for anyone else that wants minimal loot. Normally I like massive loot, but I want my next playthrough to be more challenging, item wise.\&quot;
Q: NOTHING IS SHOWING UP AT ALL FROM AWOP.
A: You need to have Fallout New Vegas updated to the latest version to run AWOP. This is the only reason (other than incorrect installation) for *nothing* to show up.
Q: Any advice on LOAD ORDERS?
A: I\&apos;ll tell you the basics about load orders though I\&apos;m not a specialist with \&apos;em. I just follow these rules:
1: ESM files go first (they have to anyway). It\&apos;s best to see ESMs and ESP as seperate lists requiring thier own attention.
2: FNV at top always followed by DLCS (so mods that use info from these can read it from them/alter it after the master files have loaded first)
3: Priority ESP files that replace a lot of data (Gameplay Overhauls) add a load of stuff or affect a lot of levelled lists (such as Weapon mods) go last so other mods cannot over-write thier changes.
Thats it really. Mods that other mods rely on have to go first and the mods you want to overwrite other things/be dominant go last.
I pretty much just use guesswork beyond that.
Also merged patches help coz if two mods affects a creatues weapon spawns one will overwrite the other without the merged patch (though often still do with one in my experience). 
Q: Can you reduce the loot?
A1: Already done, checkout the AWOP Patches site. There will be a reduced loot version released upon completion of each current main version. 
Q: Where are the quests?
A: Quests are from the following NPCs:
Colonel Hoff, (Power Plant A)
Frankie, (Frankie\&apos;s Guns &amp; Ammo)
Major Cobb, (UG Market)
Riazanov, (UG Apartment Offices)
Roach, (Freetech Boradcast Building Upper)
Sgt McMillan, (Dead Man\&apos;s Pass)
Bulldozer, (Emergency Railyard Station/Collapsed Underpass)
Also two open trade quests from:
Fabrie (Fabrie\&apos;s Shack/Haedbangerz Turf)
Schulze (UG Market)
Q: Do the ememies respawn?
A: Yes, a lot of them do, just not the boss or named characters. Most enemies in \&apos;The Underground\&apos; complex are set to not respawn so once purged you can re-use the tunnels to travel relatively safely. 
Q: Does Frankie\&apos;s inventory respawn?
A: Yes, it does but half of his initial inventory is containted within the store on shelves and such (including a lot of ammo) and these items can only be purchased once. This applies to all the vendors in the Underground too, Salamone in The Underground Armouy for example has aprrox 75% of his stock in the Armory itself and it will not respawn.
Q: Why not give the \&apos;M\&apos; weapons unique names?
A: Personally I prefer the simple \&apos;M\&apos; for two reasons:
1: The weapons are easy to find in the inventory which I find very important when carrying 20+ guns.
2: There are a lot of them about (more than one of each) so to give them personal names would not really make sense in that they are modified versions of existing weaponry as opposed to uniques. 
Q: Why M Weapons at all? Are they there coz the enemies are so tough?
A: No, they are not there because the enemies are tougher in AWOP (this never even occured to me during thier creation). Many vanilla Unique weapons are superior to M Weapons but if I had spread those about as interesting rewards many people would have rightfully complained. So to rectify this I created a new tier of weaponry. Firstly beause the challenge AWOP offers requires interesting rewards but also because I felt that many vanilla weapons were underpowered and did not want to alter any vanilla stats (to avoid conflicts). On top of this I feel it is more immersive for many reasons but mainly after 200 years all the weapons would not still be identical and NPCs cannot make used of modded weapons so fights can become unbalanced in favor of the player.
If you still do not like them as they are they can be removed using one of the Low Loot patches from the patches site or replaced and reskinned by a very cool new firearm set courtesy of Book of Earache and the BOE Patch from the AWOP/BOE Patch site.
Q: I\&apos;m getting crashes on every save or when fast-travelling or on enering locations after a certain point in the game with AWOP installed:
A: Don\&apos;t worry too much, this is not an AWOP issue, more of a discepancy between save games issue (as far as I can tell). A lot of people encounter it far a lot of reasons. For example it happened to me with no mods running whilst changing the difficulty settings a couple of times in game.
Basically you just need to find a save that still works (i.e load a back save from before the issue started), play though the same affected area again and it should work fine. 
There are ways to restore your saves but I\&apos;ve never had the time to look into it personally.
Q: Crashes at The North Cistern?
A: An edit was made, in the \&quot;A world of pain(Preview).esm\&quot; file, pertaining to the North Cistern in Westside. When you enter the cistern, Fallout crashes.
Deleting the record in FNVEdit or similar remedies the crash.
The cell is \&quot;1ECisternA\&quot;. 
[Thanks to FiftyTifty for much of the above advice in post]
It\&apos;s a small area and the only edit of it\&apos;s nature I have found in AWOP.

Q: I have killed Labal, Firetooth and/or Smokey but the quest refuses to update (one often is not marked as dead).
That\&apos;s a strange but not uncommon bug. I can only guess that it is caused by a conflict of some kind. There\&apos;s a few ways to try and tackle this problem.
Open the console in game and type the following:
setstage XX03986b 10
Replace XX with AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
That should move you to the next stage of the quest.
Alternatively in the console select the dead Gecko with the mouse and type:
resurrect
this will bring it back to life so you can kill it again.(use \&apos;kill\&apos; in console to do this quickly) I have been told doing this several times can fix the problem.
Also you can try just playing through the areas again from quest start or later.
If all these fail you most likely have a conflict (if you cannot use console either then this is almost definately the case). Try deselecting mods till everything works properly again.
Q: I killed Bertha but she won\&apos;t show up as dead:
A: Same as above with the geckos only in the console type the following to set the correct quest stage:
setstage XX03986b 30
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
Q: I\&apos;m having trouble with another part of Frankie\&apos;s Quest:
A: You have a few setsatge options to progress Frankies quest
In game open the console and type:
setstage XX03986b 10
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
10 = Just an example in this case. See below for other options:
setstage XX03986b 10 : should be the end of Kill The Geckos
setstage XX03986b 20 : Kill Bertha
setstage XX03986b 30 : Collect Key
setstage XX03986b 40 : Enter The Underground
setstage XX03986b 50 : Quest Complete XP reward.
Hopefully one of those should fix it. 
Q: Problems with ROACH\&apos;s Quest?
A: Here\&apos;s the codes for the discs. Hopefully theres a fix in there somewhere:
XX= Awops Mod Index Number (to find this in game click on something from AWOP, e.g Frankie and take the first two numbers)

Q: Where is *that* key in Spring Mt Visitors Centre?
A: [Spoiler Warning] It�s in the neighbouring underground station. It�s on a dead guy who liked to climb. You�ll need to shoot a bit of him off to get it.
Q: I Still can\&apos;t find that key.
A: [Spoiler Warning] You would be able to see him on the screenshot of the Underground Station if the resolution was much higher.
Q: That was a crap clue, seriously I have spent hours looking for this.
A: It\&apos;s on a corpse - he could have been blown to pieces already by a stray missile. If you are really stuck and can\&apos;t see the guy anywhere use \&apos;tcl\&apos; in the console to get up on top of the station entrance to Bonnie Springs Sewer. That\&apos;s where he should be.

\&quot;A World Of Pain\&quot; by David LeMaistre aka Dj Mystro
AWOP REQUIRES THE LATEST FNV PATCH to be installed.
Description:
Adds 114 intense locations to the wasteland filled with enemies and loot. They vary from small Gas Stations to huge maze-like sewers and derelict factories. Adds several days of new gameplay possibilities. A massive new linked Underground complex awaits filled with quests, NPCs with dialogue, vendors and some of the toughest enemies you will encounter anywhere in the game. Also adds many modified weapons, armors and items to the game with enhanced stats to help and hinder you throughout. 
Everything has been done using vanilla content at this stage so the filsesize should still be tiny. That said everything is complete and navmeshed and there should be no gaps or unfinished interiors.
The final version will not have a name change (I changed my mind about that) so it’s gonna be called a Preview forever.
Note about Loot: This mod adds quite a lot of loot (though much less than older versions). If you don\&apos;t like finding lots of useful stuff in most AWOP locations then get the Low Loot patches from the patches site. 
Also if you are concerned that having about 300 extra NPCs in the wasteland will slow your computer down too much grab the LowNPCs Patch (also on the AWOP Patches Site) which removes all but about 15 AWOP NPCs (from exteriors only and removes no-one important or with dialogue).
AWOP Patches Site:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40950
AWOP 4 Dead Money Updated!
-2 new interiors (linked)
-Approx 20 new Vendor Codes (for various ammos, drugs, Nuka Colas and other stuff) spread through the new locations.
-A sort of end to the mods original plot.
-A seperate patch for adding DM Vending Machines to AWOP areas.
AWOP VERSION 5.0 Overhaul Released!
[NOTE: All PATCHES need updating to match the new AWOP standards. They have all been updated too and trying to run some of the older versions will most likely lead to problems]. 
-All areas have improved lighting.
I found how to reduce the fog without losing too much darkness and have been systematically altering every location\&apos;s base light &amp; fog in order to better suit their size, location and shape. 
-Old areas revamped. 
I have been through each area alphabetically, cluttering each location to the same standard. Many extensions have also been built to smaller or previously less unique areas.
-Tons of loot reduced, altered, moved, hidden and stuffed into locked cabinets. 
Instead of 40 5.56mm expect to find clusters of 2-16 rounds in most ammo clusters but look around carefully enough and you should find some more hidden, more reloading supplies or something else to use instead.
-New Notes.
Every listed area has at least one note explaining something about what happened there (thought there are still a few limited exceptions in the Underground and in small houses). Many areas now have several notes (though they can often be hard to find). Finding certain terminal logs will also add specific AWOP Map Markers.
-New Quests.
4 new Quests added:
1: Find Baxter for Sgt Arkus.
2: Help either Legionary Burr or Frost kill the other in Canyon Station.
3: Help a mini-revolution by speaking with Marshal at Cottonwood Bunker.
4: Kill the ghouls east of Novac and find out what happened there for Reed.
-‘M’ Weapon Overhaul:
Significantly increased M Weapon Strength and Skill requirements so they are harder to use at early levels.
-New Music &amp; Ambience settings:
All big areas (and most of the others too) now have appropriate audio settings and music.
-New dialogue.
Find out about local AWOP locations through NPCs such as Rogan and Reed, one new Legion vendor and loads more quest related dialogue.
-Tiered Frankie’s weapon selection to spawn better weapons at higher levels.
-Replaced a load of Static crates in Spring Mount Visitors with more easily movable Empty Sunset Sass Crates.
-New Armors.
-For a full list of new alterations made to AWOP\&apos;s interiors check out the last part of the FAQ near the end of this page.
A WORLD OF PAIN 4 DEAD MONEY:
Adds several new locations to the Sierra Madre in Dead Money. The new locations are some of the most detailed and unique that I have attempted so far and loot is very scarce. Ammo drops are mostly in bundles of 2-8 rounds and you\&apos;ll need to use the reloading bench a lot and scavenge from every corner to get through the new encounters.
Also added are several new notes, recipes and healing items. 
[SEE BELOW \&quot;LOCATIONS ADDED\&quot; FOR MORE INFO]
INSTALLATION:
Drag AWorldOfPain(Preview).esm to the Fallout NV data folder. Select from the data menu on startup or use FOMM in the same manner. Launch game &amp; enjoy.
[WARNING 01: NEXUS MOD MANAGER Auto-Install function does not seem to work properly with this mod. Use the manual drag &amp; drop process outlined above].
[WARNING 02: AWOP adds a huge amount of content to the vanilla game. For this reason it is best played from a new game to avoid corrupting saved game data by creating large discrepencies in the back load data].
REQUIREMENTS:
None apart from one change to the Fallout_default.ini file in order to display the NPCs faces correctly.
Open the file \&apos;Fallout_default.ini\&apos; which should be found in the Steam/SteamApps/Common/FalloutNV folder. Search for the line:
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=0
and change it to
bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1
Without this all NPCs faces appear in default skin colour. Apart from this there are no requirements and the mod should run anyway. Make a backup if you are uncomfortable editing the file.
There is another version of the Fallout.ini file in the Saved game folder directory (usually in My Documents/My Games). The first one should overwrite this one but if not
changing both should do the trick.
THE BUG:
There is one remaining bug in AWOP FNV that I discovered a little too late to do anything about. It\&apos;s innocuous on it\&apos;s own but couple it with a mod with the same bug and it\&apos;s a CTD-inducer. It only happens in the North Cistern (around the Strip) so it\&apos;s not a big loss either way. The easiest process for fixing it is to run a \&quot;Identical to Master\&quot; filter in FNVEdit and delete AWOP\&apos;s reference to the Cistern from the cell menu.
For the sake of refernece any major recurring slowdown or CTDs induced after installing AWOP are the result of mod conflicts or the saved games (quick &amp; auto saves especially) trying to adjust to all the new data.
AWOP IS COMPLETD:
Hey everyone,
I\&apos;m sorry to say that I\&apos;ll probably never be updating the AWOP mods again.
It\&apos;s nothing against the Nexus or the games or modding scene in general. I feel I have done all I can with the Fallout games and have burned out on them to such an extent I can\&apos;t even play through my own stuff anymore. My mind is now on other things (happier things I feel) and I do not have the time to maintain these mods or the comments pages anymore.
Thanks for the feedback over the years and sorry if I have been a needlessly harsh gobshyte in the past. It\&apos;s nothing personal. I get frustrated easily for a lot of reasons and tend to fire off in all directions but there\&apos;s not time to go into that here.
All the best to everyone that has helped out with AWOP, any of my other mods or just enjoyed the experience and felt inclined to let me know (and the modding scene in general of course) :)
I\&apos;ll email Star now and see if she is still interested in making the voice mod. I have about 10-15 voices ready at the moment so it\&apos;s still far from complete but at least if work begins and is released people with have somewehere else to organise their comments for the mod.
If Star is unavailable I\&apos;ll upload the voices to the downloads page as a MISC download option in case anyone want\&apos;s to have a go in the future.
AWOP for FNV is officially a modder\&apos;s Resource (also Psiclones) and can be used for any purpose the Nexus community sees fit.
Feel free to copy out sections if it helps you get started on a mod.
AWOP for FO3 (and my other Fallout 3 project - Waseland Defence) is not a Modder\&apos;s resource. However I do give open permssion for any of my mods to be patched *with a seperate* .esp (or .esm if needed) in any way and for whatever reason (just to be clear duplicate main esm files are fine for the FNV stuff but not the FO3 stuff). Feel free to upload any patches without asking me for permission.
Duplicating the existing AWOP patches is fine as they are already patches though you will probably have to re-gain the permission of the original authors as well to avoid breaking any rules for uploading to the Nexus.
BOE (and it\&apos;s patches) will most likely not be returning to the Nexus. As far as I\&apos;m aware it can be found easily enough through Google searches. Unfortunately Earache has too decided to call it a day and no longer intends to update any assets claimed as stolen. I can\&apos;t blame him and wish him all the best.
If anyone want\&apos;s to be granted access to update the FNV main pages let me know why and what you have in mind and I can grant you access to page edits (though the response may take a long time).
Have fun and good luck out there all :)

NOTE ABOUT PATCHES and SAVED GAMES:
Weapon, CalX &amp; Monster Patches all effect varoius containers and NPCs affected by other recent changes. Running those patches will bring back certain NPCs Armor and weapons. I have no plans to change this unless I identify a problem (In those patches more stuff is not a bad thing - lots to buy and lots to kill).
Saved games are affected in a similar way.

DJ MYSTRO MIXSETS:
I have a large collection of very well-mixed and tracklisted mixsets that I can send people the links to if they are interested. I cannot link anything from this site due to various understandable copyright policies so if you are interested then message me your email and I\&apos;ll send you all the info you need.
Current mixes include such styles as Breakz, Breakcore, Drum &amp; Bass, Gabber, Happy Hardcore, Old Skool Rave, Electronica, Frenchcore, Speedcore and probably a few others I forgot about.
One mix is entirely made up of tracks by DJs and musicians who I named NPCs in the friendly Underground after (such as The Headbangers are \&apos;The Headbanger\&apos;, \&apos;Drokz\&apos;, \&apos;S**tmat\&apos; and the three members of \&apos;Endymion\&apos; only I used thier real names). So it\&apos;s kind of a best of the best in my opionion coz all the people down there are my biggest musical influences (for the most part).
Most of the mixes are along similar lines to tracks in the High Quality Song Preview Pack in the downloads section so if you like those you\&apos;ll probably like these.

(V3.6) Small bugfix update - Removes unwanted edits to several vanilla interiors including Primm Sherriff\&apos;s Shack.

AWOP 1.1 Released!
Small update to provide full compatability for davidallen\&apos;s \&apos;Decision With Regrets\&apos; mod. The southern Jackal camp has been moved to near the Nuclear Test Site Shacks and has been changed to a \&apos;Mad Ghoul Camp\&apos;. The ghouls there are tough but don\&apos;t respawn.
One warning - if you are running these 2 AWOP weapons patches; Ahztek\&apos;s patch or the CFW patch, both spawn Jackals in that area still.
DWR\&apos;s NPcs can handle it though since they are all essential. 
The Readme is unchanged but the FAQ has been updated.
AWOP 1.0 Released!
-‘The Professional’ Form List updated.
-New unlootable Armor for the 5 main Goodsprings NPCs.
-Underground troops removed from near quest Fiends.
-Some unimportant stuff removed from Freeside Thug Hangout
-Most Goodsprings and Novac NCR replaced by Wastelanders.
AWOP 0.8 RELAESED:
No new locations (sorry - check out the Monster Patch for those).
-NCRCF Powder Ganger Faction updated (again - for some reason the changes I made last time undid themselves).
-Lost Legion get all their missing gear back.
-Fixed a Novac Hotel Room Crash.
-Joe Cobb’s gang are now a mob of bosses and can wipe out Goodsprings without player intervention (though I have seen the battle play out many ways already).
-New levelled lists for use in the highly recommended ‘Monster Patch’.
RECOMMENDED MODS:
AWOP has been designed to be the base of a much larger project that I will never have the time to complete. To fill out the AWOP experience I would highly recommend the following mods which do a lot of the work I cannot better that I would have done:
IWS (Increased Wasteland Spawns): Loads more enemies and lots of options.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38623
VVV (Very Voracious Vermin): Like MMM if not much better.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41172
Monster Mod: Loads of new very cool and tough monsters. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41361
Hardened aka Harder Than You: Makes most enemies (especially creatures) much tougher with unique attacks.
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=43253
My Radio (Myradio):
Allows you to play your own MP3s through a new radio station. A good way to play Roach\&apos;s tracks until AWOP has it\&apos;s own station. 
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36406
More Gunz:
Book of Earache:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=41626
Classic Fallout Weapons:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37002
Ahzteks Weapon Overhaul:
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=37342
Stalker Weapon Pack
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40175
Patches in progress for all these weapon mods.
There are a whole load of other great quest and adventure mods available too but far too many to list here.
BUGS:
Possible bug when reseting this MOD with 4D storage active. Only reported once and I\&apos;ve never seen it myself but if you find you get stuck with too much carryweight (and no active storage) use this console command to deduct the relevant amount from your carryweight:
player.forceav carryweight -325 
or whatever the extra total carryweight is (250/75 etc..).
CONFLICTS:
Changes to the exterior wasteland have been kept to an absolute minimum, mostly to avoid conflicts but also to avoid heavily changing the exterior navmesh which can be very awkward at times. As a result conflicts should be minimal. Goodsprings has been changed slightly so anything that alters certain Goodsprings interiors will conflict. The same with certain Stations, shacks etc... I don\&apos;t think it will crash any games if you play with both mods running but you will only end up in the overriding mods interior.
FAQ:
Q: Is there a map?
A: There are now two detailed maps of The Underground thanks to bwilderbeast. You can check them out on the images section. Other than that there\&apos;s just the location guide.
Q: Are the NPCs voiced?
A: At the moment no NPCs have voice overs. There and over 50 NPCs with dialogue in AWOP and I do not have time to do them all. Check out the help post of info in the \&apos;REQUESTING HELP\&apos; section for more info.
Q: MY NPCS ARE EXPLODING (and armor dissapearing along with main weapons), is this a bug?
A: No, this is not a bug, this is an intentional part opf the AWOP gameplay to avoid too much unbalancing the game with too much loot. These NPCs are referred to as having Destruct on Death (or DOD) implants. See below for ways to configure these DOD NPCs.
Q: Can I turn off/alter The DOD (Destruct On Death) loot scripts?
A: [From HarderMan]  \&quot;Ya, it is optional, but you need to install MCM to use the menu to make it so. There are four options, iirc, one is to plain turn the feature on/off, the other is to turn off the feature that makes it much more difficult to disarm the affected NPCs by crippling their arms(and getting their sweet, sweet loots before they destruct), the third is to have the destructed items removed at 30% health(to prevent the possibility that a massive damage spike causes them to die before their loot is destructed, resulting in a dropped weapon), and the last is to turn on/off the destruction of all loot on death.
Again, you need The Mod Configuration Menu to be able to configure these options, it is available here:
http://newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=42507
Enjoy, and feel free to PM me with feedback, I\&apos;ll try to stop around here and see how people respond as well.
In case anyone is confused, you do not, repeat DO NOT, need MCM to use the AWOP mod, you only need MCM to adjust the loot destruction features. Default settings have high end weapons destructed on affected npcs, harder disarming of affected npcs, and high end weapon removal at 30%.
Oh, and I plan on creating a separate esp patch that will affect much more of the AWOP NPCs with loot destruction, for myself and for anyone else that wants minimal loot. Normally I like massive loot, but I want my next playthrough to be more challenging, item wise.\&quot;
Q: NOTHING IS SHOWING UP AT ALL FROM AWOP.
A: You need to have Fallout New Vegas updated to the latest version to run AWOP. This is the only reason (other than incorrect installation) for *nothing* to show up.
Q: Any advice on LOAD ORDERS?
A: I\&apos;ll tell you the basics about load orders though I\&apos;m not a specialist with \&apos;em. I just follow these rules:
1: ESM files go first (they have to anyway). It\&apos;s best to see ESMs and ESP as seperate lists requiring thier own attention.
2: FNV at top always followed by DLCS (so mods that use info from these can read it from them/alter it after the master files have loaded first)
3: Priority ESP files that replace a lot of data (Gameplay Overhauls) add a load of stuff or affect a lot of levelled lists (such as Weapon mods) go last so other mods cannot over-write thier changes.
Thats it really. Mods that other mods rely on have to go first and the mods you want to overwrite other things/be dominant go last.
I pretty much just use guesswork beyond that.
Also merged patches help coz if two mods affects a creatues weapon spawns one will overwrite the other without the merged patch (though often still do with one in my experience). 
Q: Can you reduce the loot?
A1: Already done, checkout the AWOP Patches site. There will be a reduced loot version released upon completion of each current main version. 
Q: Where are the quests?
A: Quests are from the following NPCs:
Colonel Hoff, (Power Plant A)
Frankie, (Frankie\&apos;s Guns &amp; Ammo)
Major Cobb, (UG Market)
Riazanov, (UG Apartment Offices)
Roach, (Freetech Boradcast Building Upper)
Sgt McMillan, (Dead Man\&apos;s Pass)
Bulldozer, (Emergency Railyard Station/Collapsed Underpass)
Also two open trade quests from:
Fabrie (Fabrie\&apos;s Shack/Haedbangerz Turf)
Schulze (UG Market)
Q: Do the ememies respawn?
A: Yes, a lot of them do, just not the boss or named characters. Most enemies in \&apos;The Underground\&apos; complex are set to not respawn so once purged you can re-use the tunnels to travel relatively safely. 
Q: Does Frankie\&apos;s inventory respawn?
A: Yes, it does but half of his initial inventory is containted within the store on shelves and such (including a lot of ammo) and these items can only be purchased once. This applies to all the vendors in the Underground too, Salamone in The Underground Armouy for example has aprrox 75% of his stock in the Armory itself and it will not respawn.
Q: Why not give the \&apos;M\&apos; weapons unique names?
A: Personally I prefer the simple \&apos;M\&apos; for two reasons:
1: The weapons are easy to find in the inventory which I find very important when carrying 20+ guns.
2: There are a lot of them about (more than one of each) so to give them personal names would not really make sense in that they are modified versions of existing weaponry as opposed to uniques. 
Q: Why M Weapons at all? Are they there coz the enemies are so tough?
A: No, they are not there because the enemies are tougher in AWOP (this never even occured to me during thier creation). Many vanilla Unique weapons are superior to M Weapons but if I had spread those about as interesting rewards many people would have rightfully complained. So to rectify this I created a new tier of weaponry. Firstly beause the challenge AWOP offers requires interesting rewards but also because I felt that many vanilla weapons were underpowered and did not want to alter any vanilla stats (to avoid conflicts). On top of this I feel it is more immersive for many reasons but mainly after 200 years all the weapons would not still be identical and NPCs cannot make used of modded weapons so fights can become unbalanced in favor of the player.
If you still do not like them as they are they can be removed using one of the Low Loot patches from the patches site or replaced and reskinned by a very cool new firearm set courtesy of Book of Earache and the BOE Patch from the AWOP/BOE Patch site.
Q: I\&apos;m getting crashes on every save or when fast-travelling or on enering locations after a certain point in the game with AWOP installed:
A: Don\&apos;t worry too much, this is not an AWOP issue, more of a discepancy between save games issue (as far as I can tell). A lot of people encounter it far a lot of reasons. For example it happened to me with no mods running whilst changing the difficulty settings a couple of times in game.
Basically you just need to find a save that still works (i.e load a back save from before the issue started), play though the same affected area again and it should work fine. 
There are ways to restore your saves but I\&apos;ve never had the time to look into it personally.
Q: Crashes at The North Cistern?
A: An edit was made, in the \&quot;A world of pain(Preview).esm\&quot; file, pertaining to the North Cistern in Westside. When you enter the cistern, Fallout crashes.
Deleting the record in FNVEdit or similar remedies the crash.
The cell is \&quot;1ECisternA\&quot;. 
[Thanks to FiftyTifty for much of the above advice in post]
It\&apos;s a small area and the only edit of it\&apos;s nature I have found in AWOP.

Q: I have killed Labal, Firetooth and/or Smokey but the quest refuses to update (one often is not marked as dead).
That\&apos;s a strange but not uncommon bug. I can only guess that it is caused by a conflict of some kind. There\&apos;s a few ways to try and tackle this problem.
Open the console in game and type the following:
setstage XX03986b 10
Replace XX with AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
That should move you to the next stage of the quest.
Alternatively in the console select the dead Gecko with the mouse and type:
resurrect
this will bring it back to life so you can kill it again.(use \&apos;kill\&apos; in console to do this quickly) I have been told doing this several times can fix the problem.
Also you can try just playing through the areas again from quest start or later.
If all these fail you most likely have a conflict (if you cannot use console either then this is almost definately the case). Try deselecting mods till everything works properly again.
Q: I killed Bertha but she won\&apos;t show up as dead:
A: Same as above with the geckos only in the console type the following to set the correct quest stage:
setstage XX03986b 30
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
Q: I\&apos;m having trouble with another part of Frankie\&apos;s Quest:
A: You have a few setsatge options to progress Frankies quest
In game open the console and type:
setstage XX03986b 10
XX = AWOP\&apos;s mod index number, you can find this by checking in FOMM or by activating the console and clicking on something from the mod (e.g Frankie). Then just take the first two numbers that appear after his/its name.
10 = Just an example in this case. See below for other options:
setstage XX03986b 10 : should be the end of Kill The Geckos
setstage XX03986b 20 : Kill Bertha
setstage XX03986b 30 : Collect Key
setstage XX03986b 40 : Enter The Underground
setstage XX03986b 50 : Quest Complete XP reward.
Hopefully one of those should fix it. 
Q: Problems with ROACH\&apos;s Quest?
A: Here\&apos;s the codes for the discs. Hopefully theres a fix in there somewhere:
XX= Awops Mod Index Number (to find this in game click on something from AWOP, e.g Frankie and take the first two numbers)

Q: Where is *that* key in Spring Mt Visitors Centre?
A: [Spoiler Warning] It�s in the neighbouring underground station. It�s on a dead guy who liked to climb. You�ll need to shoot a bit of him off to get it.
Q: I Still can\&apos;t find that key.
A: [Spoiler Warning] You would be able to see him on the screenshot of the Underground Station if the resolution was much higher.
Q: That was a crap clue, seriously I have spent hours looking for this.
A: It\&apos;s on a corpse - he could have been blown to pieces already by a stray missile. If you are really stuck and can\&apos;t see the guy anywhere use \&apos;tcl\&apos; in the console to get up on top of the station entrance to Bonnie Springs Sewer. That\&apos;s where he should be.

[b][size=6pt]3[/b][/size][size=4pt][center][b][color=#00BFFF]What NVEC Does
This mod is a ginormous Compilation of hundreds of different mods
All plugins are standalone meaning they don\&apos;t require each other to run unless using patches[/b][/center][/color][/size]
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete[/b] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one.[/color] This plugin is mostly a compilation of hundreds of different mods which massively reduces load orders, increases immersion, adds quests, restores uncut content, integrates new weapons/armors into the game properly, turns useless statics into containers/activators, and much more. Not only does it contain all of that, it also has my own tweaks and inclusions which are more map markers to unmarked locations, companions gear are all shown in inventories so you can fully customize your followers however you wish. Most mods merged into here have either been fixed, designed for NVEC users, changed to better suit FNV, and/or expanded to all DLCs. For the full list of inclusions, click links a little lower to make sure you don\&apos;t have a plugin running that\&apos;s already in this esm. I\&apos;ve gone through great detail and time putting this plugin together so I hope you enjoy it :)
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as Complete but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url]. The primary focus of NVCE is the alterations of NPCs, which range from cosmetic fixes, stat changes, inventory etc in order to comply with a strict principle of Fallout lore. The best way to think of this is as Fallout 3\&apos;s \&quot;Project Beauty\&quot; or the \&quot;New Vegas Redesigned\&quot;. Many of the issues addressed include terribly disproportional faces and wacky hair colouring (see pictures for more detail). Problems with faces clipping through masks or goggles for NPCs have also been addressed (ie. African American\&apos;s protruding lips cause clipping issues with Legion face masks). There are also problems with NPC inventories, and these have been addressed also. Although credit is where credits due; for most of the important named NPCs do happen to look reasonably created and far more distinctive than Fallout 3\&apos;s unique NPCs. However, there are still countless NPCs with unacceptable styles, such as bright hair, pale skin or just being plain ugly.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes[/color][/b] is a separated esm from Complete which just contains fixes to activators, ingestibles, ammunitions, armor, cells, classes, containers, creatures, dialogue topics, doors, object effects, factions, form lists, globals, head parts, lights, leveled items, messages, base effects, misc items, notes, npcs, packages, perks, projectiles, quests, recipes, scripts, sounds, actor effects, statics, terminals, texture sets, weapons, worldspaces, etc. They all are my fixes and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as NVEC BugFixes but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url].
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Enhancements[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that just contains enhancements and no bugfixes. Contains improvements, changes, expansions, tweaks, reduced annoyances, and basically making FNV badass and how it should have been in the 1st place. It\&apos;s my enhancements and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Reduce CTD[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that repairs [url=http://pastebin.com/X1Eakfup]errors/warnings[/url] in FNV and DLC ESMs reported by [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url]. This results in quests, loading worldspaces/cells, roaming the wastes, and basically running FNV in general with considerably less crashes. This plugin is how this mod all got started and where my skills mostly are.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Extras - MCM[/color][/b] is an optional plugin made separately towards the Mod Config Menu. It requires the Mod Config Menu and NVSE. It only contains the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39997]FPS Weapon Wheel[/url] at the moment. THIS PLUGIN IS STRICTLY FOR MCM MODS ONLY
[color=#FFD700][b]More Perks Merge[/color][/b] is a version of Dree\&apos;s More Perks combining all his esps/esms into one esm. Includes More Perks, More Traits, More Perks for Companions, and all his updates. The fomod installation is designed to output the NO DLC and DLC as the same name. Check lower for proper installation.

Thank you for choosing NVEC :D

[color=#FFD700]NVEC Complete[/color] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one. 
If you want everything install NVEC Complete OR NVEC Complete + NVCE. This has everything NVEC has to offer and it\&apos;s made into one esm file instead of three separate plugins. 
If you decide that you do not want to install complete you can choose from which modules you want to install(Reduce CTD, BugFixes, and Enhancements).

[*]Check the \&quot;NVEC LOAD ORDER EXAMPLE\&quot; a little lower so you know what you want to get before downloading anything
[*]Check your load order Vs [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/EnhancementModInclusions.html]Enhancement Mod Inclusions List[/url] + [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/BugfixModInclusions.html]BugFix Mod Inclusions List[/url] so you don\&apos;t have a mod running that\&apos;s already included. Remove the esps/esms from the already included mods. Uninstalling the already included mods is recommended to save space.
[*]Download what you want from the download section (this should be obvious what to do by now)
[*]Each download is not made towards NMM or a fomod so I recommend to manually install NVEC by opening with [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7zip[/url] then drag and drop into your FNV Data Folder (Your computer skills scare me if you don\&apos;t know how to do this)

[color=#FFD700]How to start it[/color][/b][/size] - You have to find Randal\&apos;s shack with a note on it which is near the [url=http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Canyon_wreckage]Canyon Wreckage[/url].

[size=3pt][b][color=#FFD700]Important[/color][/b][/size] - The laser barrier WILL kill followers that enter it. Please tell them to wait before doing so! I had to make a tough decision, but this is a no-follower quest mod. It allowed him FAR more freedom when it came to scripted cutscenes and story. There is no easy way to account for non-vanilla followers.

[b][size=6pt]3[/b][/size][size=4pt][center][b][color=#00BFFF]What NVEC Does
This mod is a ginormous Compilation of hundreds of different mods
All plugins are standalone meaning they don\&apos;t require each other to run unless using patches[/b][/center][/color][/size]
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete[/b] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one.[/color] This plugin is mostly a compilation of hundreds of different mods which massively reduces load orders, increases immersion, adds quests, restores uncut content, integrates new weapons/armors into the game properly, turns useless statics into containers/activators, and much more. Not only does it contain all of that, it also has my own tweaks and inclusions which are more map markers to unmarked locations, companions gear are all shown in inventories so you can fully customize your followers however you wish. Most mods merged into here have either been fixed, designed for NVEC users, changed to better suit FNV, and/or expanded to all DLCs. For the full list of inclusions, click links a little lower to make sure you don\&apos;t have a plugin running that\&apos;s already in this esm. I\&apos;ve gone through great detail and time putting this plugin together so I hope you enjoy it :)
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Complete + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as Complete but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url]. The primary focus of NVCE is the alterations of NPCs, which range from cosmetic fixes, stat changes, inventory etc in order to comply with a strict principle of Fallout lore. The best way to think of this is as Fallout 3\&apos;s \&quot;Project Beauty\&quot; or the \&quot;New Vegas Redesigned\&quot;. Many of the issues addressed include terribly disproportional faces and wacky hair colouring (see pictures for more detail). Problems with faces clipping through masks or goggles for NPCs have also been addressed (ie. African American\&apos;s protruding lips cause clipping issues with Legion face masks). There are also problems with NPC inventories, and these have been addressed also. Although credit is where credits due; for most of the important named NPCs do happen to look reasonably created and far more distinctive than Fallout 3\&apos;s unique NPCs. However, there are still countless NPCs with unacceptable styles, such as bright hair, pale skin or just being plain ugly.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes[/color][/b] is a separated esm from Complete which just contains fixes to activators, ingestibles, ammunitions, armor, cells, classes, containers, creatures, dialogue topics, doors, object effects, factions, form lists, globals, head parts, lights, leveled items, messages, base effects, misc items, notes, npcs, packages, perks, projectiles, quests, recipes, scripts, sounds, actor effects, statics, terminals, texture sets, weapons, worldspaces, etc. They all are my fixes and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as NVEC BugFixes but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url].
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Enhancements[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that just contains enhancements and no bugfixes. Contains improvements, changes, expansions, tweaks, reduced annoyances, and basically making FNV badass and how it should have been in the 1st place. It\&apos;s my enhancements and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Reduce CTD[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that repairs [url=http://pastebin.com/X1Eakfup]errors/warnings[/url] in FNV and DLC ESMs reported by [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url]. This results in quests, loading worldspaces/cells, roaming the wastes, and basically running FNV in general with considerably less crashes. This plugin is how this mod all got started and where my skills mostly are.
[color=#FFD700][b]NVEC Extras - MCM[/color][/b] is an optional plugin made separately towards the Mod Config Menu. It requires the Mod Config Menu and NVSE. It only contains the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39997]FPS Weapon Wheel[/url] at the moment. THIS PLUGIN IS STRICTLY FOR MCM MODS ONLY
[color=#FFD700][b]More Perks Merge[/color][/b] is a version of Dree\&apos;s More Perks combining all his esps/esms into one esm. Includes More Perks, More Traits, More Perks for Companions, and all his updates. The fomod installation is designed to output the NO DLC and DLC as the same name. Check lower for proper installation.

Thank you for choosing NVEC :D
Installations are packaged into [url=http://www.7-zip.org]7zips[/url]. Any bugs you find with NVEC and the vanilla game please report them to the comments section. I keep track of all bugs reported by users so don\&apos;t be shy.
[b][center][size=5pt][color=#00BFFF]The Downloads[/b][/center][/size][/color]
[color=#FFD700]Each is contained in a [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7zip[/url]:[/color]

[*]NVEC Complete
[*]NVEC Complete + NVCE
[*]NVEC BugFixes
[*]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE
[*]NVEC Enhancements
[*]NVEC Reduce CTD
[/list]
[color=#FFD700]NVEC Complete[/color] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one. 
If you want everything install NVEC Complete OR NVEC Complete + NVCE. This has everything NVEC has to offer and it\&apos;s made into one esm file instead of three separate plugins. 
If you decide that you do not want to install complete you can choose from which modules you want to install(Reduce CTD, BugFixes, and Enhancements).

[*]Check the \&quot;NVEC LOAD ORDER EXAMPLE\&quot; a little lower so you know what you want to get before downloading anything
[*]Check your load order Vs [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/EnhancementModInclusions.html]Enhancement Mod Inclusions List[/url] + [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5194280/NVECPages/BugfixModInclusions.html]BugFix Mod Inclusions List[/url] so you don\&apos;t have a mod running that\&apos;s already included. Remove the esps/esms from the already included mods. Uninstalling the already included mods is recommended to save space.
[*]Download what you want from the download section (this should be obvious what to do by now)
[*]Each download is not made towards NMM or a fomod so I recommend to manually install NVEC by opening with [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7zip[/url] then drag and drop into your FNV Data Folder (Your computer skills scare me if you don\&apos;t know how to do this)

[*]At the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35979]More Perks[/url] mod page, install all of its main/optional files into your FNV data folder

[*]Go to sound - voice - More Traits.esm and move those folders into =====&gt; sound/voice/More Perks.esm folder
[*]Got to sound - voice - More Perks for Honest Hearts.esm and move those folders into =====&gt; sound/voice/More Perks.esm folder
[*]Now delete the More Perks original esps/esms from FOMM or in your FNV Data folder
[*]Then you will download the merged more perks esm from the NVEC optional downloads and use FOMM - Package manager, since it\&apos;s a fomod
[*]Then you will see the More Perks esm in your load order and make sure it\&apos;s checked before playing

[color=#FFD700]Basic install:[/color]
[list]
[*]Place Extras esp and menus folder into your FNV data folder
[*]Download and use [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=38961]The Unified HUD Project[/url] to enable the HUD element. It will be checked as FPS Weapon Wheel.
[*]Place a check next to the Extras esp in whatever mod manager program you use
[*]If you previously used the newest version of the FPS Weapon Wheel then all you have to do is remove the FPSWeaponWheel.esp without needing to activate it through the unified hud again.
[/list][color=#FFD700]
You can enable the HUD element manually by the following steps:[/color][list]
[*]Go to your (installdir)\\Data\\Menus\\Main\\ folder.
[*]Open hud_main_menu.xml file in a text editor (notepad or notepad++ will do fine).
[*]Scroll to the very bottom of the file.
[*]Just above the last line which should be \&quot;&lt;/menu&gt;\&quot; paste the following.
&lt;include src=\&quot;fww\\weaponwheel.xml\&quot;/&gt;
[*]Your bottom 2 lines should now look like:
&lt;include src=\&quot;fww\\weaponwheel.xml\&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/menu&gt;[/list]
[color=#FFD700]Load Order:[/color]
[list]
[*]Recommend to load the Extras esp after the Mod Config Menu esp[/list]
[color=#FFD700]TROUBLESHOOTING WEAPON WHEEL:[/color]
[list]
[*]When I scroll while zoomed out my weapons keep switching. Hold \&quot;F\&quot; to avoid that when zooming in and out
[*]If nothing happens when you scroll up and down then you haven\&apos;t activated it yet with the Unified Hud
[*]If you scroll up and down only hearing beeping sounds then change the minimum clip count to 0
[/list]
[color=#FFD700]Uninstall Weapon Wheel:[/color]
[list]
[*]Untick and/or remove the Extras esp
[*]Deactivate FPS Weapon Wheel in Unified Hud
[*]If you had your hotkeys on the mousewheel, be sure to go into 3rd person mode and save like that, before uninstalling.
[*]If you were using custom hotkeys, you can simply uninstall anyways.

[size=3pt][b][color=#FFD700]Important[/color][/b][/size] - The laser barrier WILL kill followers that enter it. Please tell them to wait before doing so! I had to make a tough decision, but this is a no-follower quest mod. It allowed him FAR more freedom when it came to scripted cutscenes and story. There is no easy way to account for non-vanilla followers.

No idea about tags or cleansing-needs.
I figured this very downloaded mod to be an equivalent to Fallout3&apos;s Unofficial Update-Patch. Allthough this won&apos;t work as I have far from all DLC&apos;s.
Just playing and struggling with mod&apos;s I appreciate this tool greatly, allthough I have
a &apos;common grip&apos; on load-orders.
Could contribute with many more links/descriptions to mod&apos;s for Oblivion if it&apos;s still being updated or of any interest...

YUP (as I&apos;m going to call it) is just what it sounds like: an unofficial patch for Fallout: New Vegas. YUP addresses a number of bugs, exploits, and other such issues with Fallout: New Vegas that were not fixed by the final official patch to the game. There are enough bugs left in the game that having some mod which fixes them is vital, and (in my slightly biased opinion) YUP meets that need admirably.</thetext>

A fair number of mods for Fallout: New Vegas come in ESM format rather than ESP format. YUP needs to be loaded before these mods to ensure that its changes don&apos;t cause compatibility issues with these other mods. The only way to make that possible is to release the mod as an ESM.</thetext>

&quot;Place YUP at the top of your load order, directly underneath all of the base game and DLC packages, so that other mods which alter similar parts of the game don&apos;t get messed up. Yes, even above other mods which say &quot;put at the top of your load order&quot;. YUP might undo changes those mods make otherwise, and that would be bad!&quot;</thetext>

YUP (as I&apos;m going to call it) is just what it sounds like: an unofficial patch for Fallout: New Vegas. YUP addresses a number of bugs, exploits, and other such issues with Fallout: New Vegas that were not fixed by the final official patch to the game. There are enough bugs left in the game that having some mod which fixes them is vital, and (in my slightly biased opinion) YUP meets that need admirably.</thetext>

So, it has come to this....
I&apos;ve been making bug fixes for Fallout: New Vegas for years. It was inevitable, really. Sooner or later I was bound to have a direct hand in some kind of bug fix compilation for the game, rather than just sitting back and letting someone else do all the hard work of merging and checking compatibility. Others had filled the role in the past - Zenball, Dynastia, Linmor, more I&apos;m sure I&apos;m forgetting - but they&apos;ve moved on, and now it&apos;s my turn.
So here it is: my effort in creating a successor to the various Community Bugfix Compilations and Inofficial Patches. I give you (drumroll please):
Yukichigai&apos;s Unofficial Patch
(Or &quot;YUP&quot; for short)
I know, terribly inventive name. At least it abbreviates well.
What is Yukichigai&apos;s Unofficial Patch anyway?
YUP (as I&apos;m going to call it) is just what it sounds like: an unofficial patch for Fallout: New Vegas. YUP addresses a number of bugs, exploits, and other such issues with Fallout: New Vegas that were not fixed by the final official patch to the game. There are enough bugs left in the game that having some mod which fixes them is vital, and (in my slightly biased opinion) YUP meets that need admirably.
So what does it fix?
A lot of bugs in the main game as well as all DLCs (Courier&apos;s Stash, Dead Money, Gun Runners&apos; Arsenal, Honest Hearts, Lonesome Road, and Old World Blues).
What bugs? Well it&apos;s a really, really long list, several pages in fact and too much to put in the main description. You can check the full list of fixes by checking the ReadMe section for this mod. If you don&apos;t want to though, here are some examples:
- Fixes the Dead Money perk In Shining Armor so that it actually does something
- Corrects the female mesh for the Pimp-Boy 3 Billion so that it&apos;s not held at an angle
- Fixes Boone&apos;s head tracking and stops him from holstering his weapon every 5 seconds in combat
- Alters Fixer so that it cures addiction temporarily as it says, not permanently
- Ultrajet addiction can now be cured by doctors
- Stops various dead NPCs and creatures from miraculously resurrecting 3 days later
- Ensures the Brotherhood of Steel Explosive Collar won&apos;t detonate after its removed from your neck
- Prevents the Old World Blues trait Skilled from being taken, then removed to leave a permanent +5 to all skills.
And many, many more things after that. If it&apos;s broken, YUP probably fixes it.
Okay, what doesn&apos;t it fix?
Any fixes I either couldn&apos;t get permission for, or couldn&apos;t integrate for technical reasons (e.g. requires NVSE, etc.) I recommend you download these fixes and run them alongside YUP, if possible.

Also, anything I don&apos;t know about! I&apos;m not just the guy who maintains this mod, I also fix bugs myself. I&apos;m not clairvoyant though, so in order to fix a bug I have to know about it first. If you have a bug you&apos;ve found, leave me a message (here in the comments thread, since my inbox gets full frequently). If it&apos;s a bug, I&apos;ll do my best to fix it.
Why should I use YUP instead of other mods?
Good question, and one with a good answer: YUP is the only pure bug fix compilation available on the Nexus.
What do I mean by &quot;pure&quot;? I mean a mod that does not also contain any new content, restored content, new features, balance tweaks, or other general non-bug-fix changes. Every single change in YUP exists to address a bug, exploit, or impediment to gameplay. No other mod currently on the Nexus can make that claim. No, not even that one everyone recommends (and no, I won&apos;t be more specific). If another pure bug fix compilation existed I wouldn&apos;t have made this one.
Is this mod compatible with &lt;insert name here&gt;?
YUP is designed to be compatible with as many mods as possible. Every record it changes is one which needs to be changed in order to fix a bug. Ideally, the only reason a mod will override one of YUP&apos;s fixes is if it changes the fundamental way the object/script/etc. in question operates.
If nothing else, remember this: so long as you load YUP at the top of your load order, it should not cause any conflicts or negative effects.
How do I use YUP?
Same as any other mod: download the ESM, then add it to your load order. Place YUP at the top of your load order, directly underneath all of the base game and DLC packages, so that other mods which alter similar parts of the game don&apos;t get messed up. Yes, even above other mods which say &quot;put at the top of your load order&quot;. YUP might undo changes those mods make otherwise, and that would be bad!
There are two versions of YUP available for download: one for users with all five of the main DLCs, and one for users who lack at least one of the DLCs, not counting Courier&apos;s Stash. If you have the five main DLCs (or the Ultimate edition of the game) then you want to download the standard version, &quot;YUP - Base Game + All DLC&quot;. This comes in one single file for your convenience.
For those of you missing at least one of the five main DLCs, you should download the &quot;Individual ESMs&quot; version, then use the Nexus Mod Manager to enable only the ESM files which correspond to the portions of the game you own. At the very least &quot;YUP - Base Game&quot; should be enabled and placed at the top of your load order, with any DLC fix packages loading immediately after it.
Why ESM? Why not ESP?
A fair number of mods for Fallout: New Vegas come in ESM format rather than ESP format. YUP needs to be loaded before these mods to ensure that its changes don&apos;t cause compatibility issues with these other mods. The only way to make that possible is to release the mod as an ESM.
How does support for Courier&apos;s Stash work?
Courier&apos;s Stash - otherwise know as the Caravan Pack, Classic Pack, Mercenary Pack, and Tribal Pack - is supported by YUP without requiring it. The main &quot;Base Game + All DLC&quot; version of the mod includes fixes for the various elements of Courier&apos;s Stash but can still be used without error if you do not have it or one of the packs that makes it up.
For any other DLC this would be impossible, but Courier&apos;s Stash uses a special method of adding items to the game known as &quot;record injection&quot;. What this means is that even though another file adds these special pre-order weapons and armor to the game, internally they are treated as though they are part of the main FalloutNV.esm file, e.g. the Broad Machete has the FormID 001735e5, not xx1735e5. This means that YUP can include modifications to those items even if the items themselves aren&apos;t there and the game will process them without issue (technically, it treats it as another record injection).
Note that even though Courier&apos;s Stash allows YUP to break the normal way things work in this regard, other rules still apply. You must still load YUP after the Pre-Order Packs/Courier&apos;s Stash for its fixes to be applied.
Does YUP require NVSE or &lt;insert name here&gt;?
Absolutely not. All of YUP&apos;s content is made to work with the base unmodified game, no other utilities required. You can run YUP on a brand spanking new fresh install of New Vegas without installing anything else.
I want to help! How can I?
Tons of ways. If you have any talent with editing the game, you can always contribute bug fixes to the Nexus. Just make sure to tag your fixes as at least &quot;can reuse with credit&quot; in the permissions section.
Do you speak a language other than English? YUP needs help in producing versions for non-English installs, since quite a few fixes have been made to dialog choices and so on.
Not so good with editing? Just point me towards some bugs when you find them, or some bug fix packages I&apos;ve somehow overlooked. While I&apos;m proud of YUP, I will never claim that it fixes all the bugs in the game, ever. I&apos;m always looking for more bugs to fix.
Don&apos;t have any more bugs to point out? Feedback is always appreciated! Leave me a comment in the comments section.
For any of you who are more visual minded, you may have noticed that the mod page is somewhat lacking on images. Feel free to submit your images for the mod! Just go to the images tab and upload your screenshots. I&apos;ll add anything that seems appropriate.
Anything else?
I would just like to give a big thank you to all of the other modders out there who created the bug fixes used for this compilation. Nothing shows your love of a game like being willing to get elbow-deep in it so you can fix its bugs and issues. It&apos;s people like you that make Fallout: New Vegas a game worth playing.
A separate thank you goes to xporc of the FOOK team, who personally went through FOOK&apos;s latest release and made a special ESM of bug fixes the team was allowed to share with me. A great many bug fixes in this mod are due to his efforts.
I&apos;d also like to thank miguick, who has provided both insightful feedback on this compilation along with some bug fixes of his own. Some very nice catches in there.
Additional thanks go to ElminsterAU, Zilav, and Sharlikran for their work on TES5Edit, A.K.A. FNVEdit, a tool without which this compilation would not be possible.
Another big, big thanks to The 3rd Type for making the logo for YUP. He jumped at the chance to make a logo for me, and his help is greatly appreciated given that I&apos;m rubbish at visuals. :P</thetext>

This removes a couple unused items from the game to create a better performance. To better explain hat I mean by unused I mean literally unused. For example, the GECK showed the items being used in the world 0 times, with 0 references, and no forms of quests using it. So, completely unused. This DOES NOT REMOVE any items that you might use in some shape or form. One rock type was removed. It was used thousands of times. It was a small cave rock. Useless. The rock was NOT used to cover up landscape clipping.
This removes some objects that the game does not use in any way. By doing this, the game has less data to process, and a better performance is created (More FPS &amp; less lag). Although my computer is very powerful, the mod still helps it out. I go crazy if I can get my hands on something that makes something better.</thetext>

This is a remake of my Better Game Performance mod for Fallout 3.
It was listed on the Fallout 3 Master List, which is basically a list of must - have mods.

This mod adds more versatile weather effects to the Mojave. Weather effects include Sandstorms, Rain, Rainstorms, RADstorms (make sure you got Rad-X), Thunderstorms (with/without rain) and snow at appropriate areas. The Mod adds more than 320 new cloud- and weather variants to the game. Sunrises and sunsets have been tweaked for more diversity, and nights are darker and do look more like real nights. Additional changes to the environmental light appearance to support the weather appearance and the mood they create. Bloom effect reworked to reduce NPC and player figure glow appearance. Also this weather mod provides you with a large amount of special weather themes, that create a unique and new feeling to the game and can be activated as standalone or as part of the main climate. Some of those moods have special effects such as snow, icestorms, toxicstorms and firestorms</thetext>

Nevada Skies 
This mod adds more versatile weather effects to the Mojave. Weather effects include Sandstorms, Rain, Rainstorms, RADstorms (make sure you got Rad-X), Thunderstorms (with/without rain) and snow at appropriate areas. The Mod adds more than 320 new cloud- and weather variants to the game. Sunrises and sunsets have been tweaked for more diversity, and nights are darker and do look more like real nights. Additional changes to the environmental light appearance to support the weather appearance and the mood they create. Bloom effect reworked to reduce NPC and player figure glow appearance. Also this weather mod provides you with a large amount of special weather themes, that create a unique and new feeling to the game and can be activated as standalone or as part of the main climate. Some of those moods have special effects such as snow, icestorms, toxicstorms and firestorms</thetext>

This mod adds more versatile weather effects to the Mojave. Weather effects include Sandstorms, Rain, Rainstorms, RADstorms (make sure you got Rad-X), Thunderstorms (with/without rain) and snow at appropriate areas. The Mod adds more than 320 new cloud- and weather variants to the game. Sunrises and sunsets have been tweaked for more diversity, and nights are darker and do look more like real nights. Additional changes to the environmental light appearance to support the weather appearance and the mood they create. Bloom effect reworked to reduce NPC and player figure glow appearance. Also this weather mod provides you with a large amount of special weather themes, that create a unique and new feeling to the game and can be activated as standalone or as part of the main climate. Some of those moods have special effects such as snow, icestorms, toxicstorms and firestorms</thetext>

This mod adds speed glasses to the game. Wearing them will allow your character to run extremely fast.
Place the mod file in the Fallout New Vegas\Data directory
Activate the mod (start Fallout and click data on the splash screen then click on the speed glasses mod)
The glasses appear in a footlocker just inside Doc Mitchell&apos;s house (the starting location)
There are two pairs of each so you may be able to give one to a companion
Go to apparel in the pipboy and equip the speed glasses
speed glasses 200 makes walking and running 2x faster
speed glasses 400 makes walking as fast as running used to be and running 4x faster
Don&apos;t forget you can toggle between walk and run (caps lock key) to slow down and speed up
Note, unlike the rather lame setgs fmoverunmult console hack, this mod should affect only the player, leaving the rest of the world at normal speed.
Have fun</thetext>

NOT lore friendly if the PipBoy barrel is a must have to feel pure when playing!
Since it now is a FOMOD it&apos;s alot easier to install/uninstall. However all saves made when using this mod will still require the point 3 action under Manual Uninstall.
If a player have other PipBoy changers installed that is not the vanilla ones this mod will fail. Restore your game play to use a default PipBoy before enable this mod.
When enabled this quest script will check once and remove any standard equipped PipBoy, PimpBoy and PipBoyGlove.
After this a constant check is done to fetch when a player enter the menu PipBoy mode, and equip a modified PipBoy without the barrel, lamps or buttons. It will &quot;just&quot; show a screen.
When entering game mode after a PipBoy session the script unequip the PipBoy and make a fast uneqip and equip of the armor/clothing that is equipped to upperbody. The reason to this is that the game is hardcoded to shrink whatever clothing where the PipBoy is mounted, and I tell it looks crazy if you watch it in 3rd player view.</thetext>

This mod removes the PipBoy in game mode and only mounts a heavily modified one when in menu mode.
You MUST have NVSE running or it will break, I heavily depend on the GetEquippedObject function to make this mod &quot;smooth&quot; in usage.
Updated to 0.71 and added a workaround for PipBoyLight.
With version 0.7 and as a FOMOD I recommend all to try that out. It makes it a lot easier to install and uninstall!
A lot of options are added to customize and the main three buttons are now placed at the bottom of the menu screen.
New options are color and language of the three buttons and a option to add transparency to the menu screen. Note that the transparency is for everything on the menu screen not just the background.
I consider it now as finished and will only fix bugs related to this release. This mod already has taken an overwhelming more time than I ever could have predicted.

Install
=======
Since it now is a FOMOD just grab it with the mod manager you use and activate it, the installer script and options given are self explaining.
A tip, make a save point before activating this mod. Activate it and just play around without doing to much quests, if it is not to your liking then you just have to uninstall and continue from the save point before the mod.</thetext>

Doctor XP Version 1 (aka XPCheatNPC)
This mod adds an NPC to Doc Mitchell’s House (called “Doc XP”) who grants XP Points and can also offer the player a large number of selectable items an infinite amount of times.
This mod was created for testing purposes initially (I needed to test many high level areas and start a new game at the same time to make sure everything had spawned properly) but I figured other people may find it useful as when I last searched I could not find anything like it. 
To make Doc XP more useful to everyone I gave her options for the following stuff:
-4D Storage
4D Storage devices increase carryweight by optional increments of 100, 200, 400 and 800. Unlike the other objects they can only be selected once.
-XP Points:
Available in blocks of 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and 20,000
-Ammo
All vanilla variants come in 100 rounds (average) and in up to 3 types (e.g choosing 5.56 would give 100 5.56mm Standard, 100 AP &amp; 100 HP rounds). Ammo variants with more than 3 types (12 Gauge for example) have had the most common variants selected.
-Armor
About 10 armors to chose from ranging from 6DT (Bounty Hunter Duster) to 32DT (Enclave Power Armor)
-Caps
Caps available in small or very large amounts
-Weapons
A variety of weapons to chose from to suit all play styles with ammunition where appropriate (average 100 rounds standard ammo).
-Misc Supplies
Stuff for hardcore mode such as food and water plus meds, steathboys, anti-rads and scrap metal.
LOCATION:
Wandering around the kitchen area in Doc Mitchell&apos;s House

This mod adds an announcer to Fallout New Vegas.  It was ported from the mod from Fallout 3.  I&apos;m not clear on all it&apos;s features but it adds a bottle cap reward feature for kills.  The announcer announces first blood, multi kills, headshots, and killing sprees with different bottle cap rewards for each.  I&apos;m not sure what else it announces.</thetext>

Logically, the Energy Weapons of Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas should be WAY stronger. I mean, I&apos;m firing concentrated Plasma at you! It should be doing more than tickling you! This made me mad, but I just shrugged it off and ignored every Energy Weapon in both games (Minus the Gauss Rifle in FO3). Once I bought a gaming PC, I looked for mods that changed this. I found one for Fallout3, but none for F:NV. Again, I shrugged this off and never touched the guns. Then I bought Fallout 1 and 2 (Sadly no longer available). There, most Energy Weapons can hold up into very late in the game, and the Plasma Rifle is the best weapon to take to the final bosses. What the hell Bethesda? I understand the balance is important, but you made the weapons as bad as possible to achieve that? Almost none of the guns (Again, with the exception of the Gauss Rifle and Tesla Cannon, although there are better choices than even these) are worth taking to Hoover Dam for the final battle, almost none of them are useful past level 20.
Well, now I decided to change that. When finished those games, I started up my G.E.C.K and changed around some data values. This mod isn&apos;t too great, I understand, and it might even flip the problem for some, making the guns TOO powerful. But, in a single-player game anyway, isn&apos;t it better to have something a bit too powerful than way too weak? These aren&apos;t broken, at least in my opinion, but they are respectable, they do last you a while into the game and some last until the end of the game. They have good stopping power and, at last, compete with Guns. Also, the Unique Variants of the Plasma and Laser rifles are now worth finding.
The files are all standalone. None of the DLC files include the Vanilla weapons, so you have to get that file to get those changes. If you own Either the GOTY edition or the have the standard version but have bought GRA, HH and OWB you can get the Merged File that includes all of the other files. Please report any issues with the Merged one, my Merging skills aren&apos;t exactly the best and I&apos;ve screwed it up before. Nothing came up in my testing, except the MF Recharge Pistol bug in the GRA version, which I fixed in the latest version.</thetext>

Book Diversity Project by Yossarian
This mod is something I had in mind for a very long time. One thing I always loved about the elder scrolls was collecting books. The Fallout Games don&apos;t offer a lot for this interest. So this mod aims to change it.
My planing is, that I will update this mod frequently and add more and more books over time, so this should be just a start. If you want help me to create new books, you could use the template I&apos;ve placed as a picture. Just download it and create your own book. Afterwards upload it here or send it to me and I will surely add it with the next update.</thetext>

This mod will add a metal crate to the porch of the Prospector Saloon in Goodsprings. Inside the crate there will be some chokers. Equip then un-equip (no point to keeping it equipped) the choker that has the run speed you want in its&apos; title and you will get increased run speed for you and your companions, present and future. NPCs will be unaffected by the speed increase. Also, while sneaking or fighting, run speed will return to normal. There is also a choker to remove the perk. If you want to change your run speed in-game, just pick another choker.
I made this because I couldn&apos;t find a run speed mod that I liked. I didn&apos;t want to wear an item all the time to increase run speed, I just wanted something simple I could do once and forget about.
New in version 1.4:
Speed is reduced to normal during crippling limb damage to legs (optional)
New in version 1.31:
Fixed &quot;always on&quot; version.
Cleaned up general mod structure. 
Fixed broken download link.
New in version 1.3:
Run speed now normal in combat
Added &quot;always on&quot; version. 
New in version 1.2:
-Mod no longer increases sneak speed
-Scripting improvements mean it&apos;s no longer necessary to use the &quot;remove perk&quot; choker between speed changes.
-If my math is right, values should now be precise, not estimates.
-Added CrazyGoNuts speed. Careful, bumps in the terrain can launch you high in the air. Sneak speed is still increased for this mode.
-Added icons, FWIW (vanilla)
New in version 1.11:
Added 125% speed.
New in version 1.1:
-I changed the mod to use chokers instead of magazines because I couldn&apos;t get magazines to run a script on activate, it&apos;s easier to run a script on equip. Now instead of having 5 esp files there is one, only with 6 items, but run speed can be changed in-game.
-I also had a problem with the first version where sometimes new companions would run too fast, so I changed from a speed multiplier to a set value. Because of this, speed percentages are approximate.
-One other thing that was a little flaky in version 1.0, it seemed that sometimes new companions would not get the speed bonus. That seems to be fixed now.
Included speeds are:
125%
150%
200% 
250%
275%
300%
CrazyGoNuts
Bugs:
Occasionally a speed change will fail to occur on start/end of combat. If this happens, go in and out of sneak mode to fix it. I&apos;ll maybe try using a different condition on the perk to try and fix it, if anyone has suggestions I would certainly like to hear them.
Occasionally a new companion will not get the perk. Re equip and un-equip the choker. Not sure how to fix this one, suggestions encouraged.
Special Thanks:
Xaranth from the forums for helping me with the speed decrease during combat.</thetext>

          <long_desc isprivate="0">
            <thetext>http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51524/
Project Nevada has a bug with Med-X withdrawal, which causes withdrawal effects to be applied immediately upon becoming addicted, and not be removed when more Med-X is taken.
The fix for this is simple - other withdrawal effects (such as for Jet) have a condition that checks for the ignore crippled limbs effect, and does not apply the withdrawal effect until ignore crippled limbs is no longer active, whereas the Med-X withdrawal effect does not contain this check. Adding this condition fixes the Project Nevada bug.
A side effect of this fix is that Med-X also temporarily alleviates withdrawal symptoms of all other drugs. Whilst this might be considered overpowered, it&apos;s a trade off I&apos;m willing to make in order to fix the bug. I have altered the effect description of Med-X to &apos;Ignores Crippled Limbs &amp; Withdrawal Symptoms&apos; in order to reflect its new powers.
Feel free to do what you want with this file, no permissions necessary. It can be easily merged in to a bashed patch and de-activated.</thetext>

This mod contains a new race, some weapons from Fallout 3, new textures, several armors, a skeleton for body physics (adult content), an NPC follower, and a case of ammo that is so large the room gets laggy until the chest of ammo is emptied.</thetext>

All this does is disable the quests that cause the popups and put the items from the preorder packs into your inventory. All the items are just in a locker next to Doc Mitchel when you wake up. Made this for myself because i was tired of all the popups and the extra inventory managment it added when i started a new game, I figure others might be looking for this.
You will need the Courier&apos;s Stash dlc for this to work.
Doesn&apos;t remove anything so it should not conflict with any mods
As with all mods just add it to your data folder and activate with your mod manager of choice.</thetext>

This mod removes bodies, fires, legion dogs and flags from nipton, after 48 hours. In order to trigger the mod, simply approach nipton.
Of note, boxcar and the paranoid,tinkerers house are untouched. I didnt want to mess with vanilla quests in boxcars case, and in the other, nobody in their right mind would risk themselves to clean the other two houses.
I envision this as a modders resource. You can set mavnip. That is the persistent reference I made, and enable &quot;opposite of parent&quot; to trigger any spawns or items you want to move in. This way you don&apos;t have to worry about the 50+ items that any sane person would have moved out of the town before moving in.
Please feel free to build on the mod, just give me some credit :)</thetext>

So what does this mod do exactly?
It adds over 120 new leveled lists that build in a framework that allows me to add, for example, one combat armor variant to one leveled list, and have it automatically get seeded into the rest of the mod, and, into the inventories of NPCs all over the Mojave Wasteland.</thetext>

===========   
Description   
=========== 
I was always put off by the fact that 90% of the population seemed to wear the exact same armor/clothing with the exact same hat as everyone else, the end of the world may have happened but that doesn\&apos;t mean everyone found and wears the exact same piece of clothing.
This mod aims to try and lessen this issue by adding more clothing/armor variety into the wasteland through the use of level lists.
This mod includes:
Backpacks: 11
Gloves: 21
Headgear: 47
Armors/Clothing: 29
Poncho: 7

==========   
Plugins  
========== 
If you are updating from 0.7 to version 1.0, you do not NEED to make a clean save but I highly suggest you do so. To make a clean save you need to, find a safe indoor spot (no enemy respawns) and save. Now uninstall the mod, and load the save. save again. Now install the mod. Wait inside for 4 days so everyone\&apos;s level lists can reset.
If you do NOT do a clean save, please try and remove any Pickelhaube Helmets and Wasteland Survivor outfit from your inventory or your companion\&apos;s inventory before updating. Wait inside for 4 days so everyones level lists can reset after updating. 
----------------
Main plugins:
----------------
1nivVSLArmors.esp: This is the main plugin, it places items through out the game in level lists/vendors.
---------------------------
Optional player only plugin:
---------------------------
DO NOT USE this with the Diversified Mojave Wasteland patch.
Player only version: This is the player only version, it places the armors in boxes you find in Goodsprings and in vendors. There are no items found in level lists.
-------------------
Optional Patches:
-------------------
Optional patches require BOTH Spice Of Life AND the mod they patch to be installed and/or turned on.
................
Cheater Patch
................
1nivVSLArmors Cheat.esp: This is a patch that adds four boxes to Goodsprings, for those who want to cheat to get the items but also want the level list edits of the Main plugin. DO NOT USE this with the Optional player only plugin.
...................................................................
Breezes New Vegas Males: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35451
...................................................................
NivSpiceofLife Breeze Patch: This is a optional patch to make the armors fit Breeze\&apos;s male body, it may not be as up to date as the main file but will still work.
.......................................................................
Diversified Mojave Wasteland: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/42007
.......................................................................
1nivDWSLPatch.esp: This is a patch for the mod Diversified Mojave Wasteland, it provides much more diversity of items.
.........................................................
Project Nevada: http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/40040
.........................................................
1nivPNSLPatch.esp: This is a patch for the mod Project Nevada, it provides image overlays for headgear. To keep the night vision items added to be balanced, you only find broken versions off enemies. To make working versions go to the workbench, you need to repair them:
1 Broken item
2 Spare Parts
1 Fission Battery
3 Scrap Electronics
2 Sensor Module
=====================   
FAQ / Troubleshooting  
=====================
Q: Why are all the items invisible/or a red !?
A: You did not install the mod correctly, please take a moment to read through the installation section.
Q: My game crashes on start up.
A: You have installed a mod that does not have the required master installed. Please take some time and read through the plugin section.
Q: Where do you get the items in game?
A: You can find all items (but one) in game on random NPCs and through Vendors, the Zombieland outfit is only found in Chet\&apos;s store and rarely on other vendors.
A: If you use Player only version you can find all the items in some chests in Goodsprings. See picture for location.
Q: How long does it take for the items to show up in game?
A: About 4 days waiting will reset all NPC spawns that have already spawned, if you enter a new area that you have not been in before it should work right away.
Q. Will this work with Vanilla bodies?
A. No it will not work right, you will get splotches and skin issues if you use vanilla bodies with this mod.
Q. What about type 6?
A. Yes it will work with type 6 because they use the same textures as Type3.
Q. Does this work with the pipboy?
A. Yes, the new update makes it pipboy compatible.
Q. Why do some of the Project Nevada items take up the headband slot when they do not need to?
A. That is a requirement for some of the effects to work.
Q. Will this work with mods like Fook and Project Nevada?
A. It should work with mods that edit the level lists just put the mod you want to work last (or use a bashed/merged patch). Make sure you grab the PN patch.
Q: Is this mod compatible with?
A. If the mod adds items to the same level lists then it will conflict, nothing game breaking will happen simply which ever mod is lower in the load order will show up on that NPC. Try making a bashed or merged patch for best compatibility.
Q. Why do the gloves clip or have a gap?
A. That is just how the gloves where made, its a vanilla issue.
Q. Where can I find the Zombieland outfit or its not showing up at the store.
A. It is the only thing in this mod you can NOT find in the world level lists, you can buy it in Chet\&apos;s store and possibly other stores as well if your lucky.
Q. Do the boobs bounce?
A. No.
Q. I saw some face masks in your WIP pics why are they not in game?
A. Permission was currently denied.
Q. I think a item is unbalanced.
A. Please either post or pm me.
Q. Will you make this for FO3?
A. That is hard to say right now, this mod uses a ton of NV assets I would have to remove them and edit everything... we will see.

Q: WHY NOT VANILLA BODIES?
A: BECAUSE NO ONE IS PAYING ME FOR THE HOURS I WOULD HAVE TO PUT INTO IT, I DO NOT USE VANILLA I DO NOT LIKE IT. I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE 4 VERSIONS OF THE SAME ARMOR FOR DIFFERENT BODIES.
UNLESS SOMEONE IS PAYING ME FOR ALL MY TIME IT WILL NOT HAPPEN, SORRY I JUST DO NOT HAVE THE TIME FOR ROBERT AND BREEZE AND TYPE 3 AND VANILLA BODIES . I THINK THREE OUT OF FOUR IS MORE THEN ENOUGH.
Breeze body patch is FULLY updated to version 1.2, I have completely remade the patch and it now contains the same functions as the main file (Roberts version).
All 1.2 versions contain:
- Wound decal compatibility
- Pipboy compatibility
========== 
Updates 
==========
1.2:
- Name changes
- Bandage hand wrap glove female
- New glove ground meshes 
- Level list fixes
- Aviator glasses remade with new textures
- New aviator glasses added +8
- Bandit masks added +9
- Remade backpacks
- Resized backpacks
- New ponchos added +2
- Brand new from scratch jean textures
- Added Rugged outfits +3
- Updated Diversified Mojave Wasteland patch
- Remade Project Nevada patch to use scripts
- Brand new hand made icons for all items added
=========== 
Description 
=========== 
I was always put off by the fact that 90% of the population seemed to wear the exact same armor/clothing with the exact same hat as everyone else, the end of the world may have happened but that doesn&apos;t mean everyone found and wears the exact same piece of clothing.
This mod aims to try and lessen this issue by adding more clothing/armor variety into the wasteland through the use of level lists.
This mod includes:
Backpacks: 11
Gloves: 21
Headgear: 64
Armors/Clothing: 32
Poncho: 9

===================== 
FAQ / Troubleshooting 
=====================
Q. Will this work with Vanilla bodies?
A. No it will not work right, you will get splotches and skin issues if you use vanilla bodies with this mod.
Q: Why are all the items invisible/or a red !?
A: You did not install the mod correctly, please take a moment to read through the installation section.
Q: My game crashes on start up.
A: You have installed a mod that does not have the required master installed. Please take some time and read through the plugin section.
Q: Where do you get the items in game?
A: You can find all items (but one) in game on random NPCs and through Vendors, the Zombieland outfit is only found in Chet&apos;s store and rarely on other vendors.
A: If you use Player only version you can find all the items in some chests in Goodsprings. See picture for location.
Q: How long does it take for the items to show up in game?
A: About 4 days waiting will reset all NPC spawns that have already spawned, if you enter a new area that you have not been in before it should work right away.
Q. What about type 6?
A. Yes it will work with type 6 because they use the same textures as Type3.
Q. Does this work with the pipboy?
A. Yes, the new update makes it pipboy compatible.
Q. Why do some of the Project Nevada items take up the headband slot when they do not need to?
A. That is a requirement for some of the effects to work.
Q. Will this work with mods like Fook and Project Nevada?
A. It should work with mods that edit the level lists just put the mod you want to work last (or use a bashed/merged patch). Make sure you grab the PN patch.
Q: Is this mod compatible with?
A. If the mod adds items to the same level lists then it will conflict, nothing game breaking will happen simply which ever mod is lower in the load order will show up on that NPC. Try making a bashed or merged patch for best compatibility.
Q. Why do the gloves clip or have a gap?
A. That is just how the gloves where made, its a vanilla issue.
Q. Where can I find the Zombieland outfit or its not showing up at the store.
A. It is the only thing in this mod you can NOT find in the world level lists, you can buy it in Chet&apos;s store and possibly other stores as well if your lucky.
Q. Do the boobs bounce?
A. No.
Q. I think a item is unbalanced.
A. Please either post or pm me.
Q. Will you make this for FO3?
A. That is hard to say right now, this mod uses a ton of NV assets I would have to remove them and edit everything... we will see.

CREDITS &amp; PERMISSIONS 
===================== 
Nivea (me): For taking the time to put together the resources of other modders, for making male or female versions of most the resources that had none. Also for making new armors/clothing/icons along with new textures or normal maps for other armors in the mod as well as reducing the poly count, and making all new ground meshes for all armors.
tumbajamba: For the large amount of armors and item I used from many of his FO3 mods namely, Brutal Raider Outfit, Raider Leather Armor, Metal armor variation, Scavenger Armors.
I forgot to add Kendo 2 to the Breeze credit readme, I used his awesome BIG BOY for Breeze Male body. Its higher poly and looks much nicer. When I update the mod next your name will be in the readmes. :)

          <long_desc isprivate="0">
            <thetext>http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41210
Thanks to a new challenge included in the Dead Money DLC, Caravan Cards now have yet ANOTHER new script controlling how they are added to your Caravan deck. For the non-Sierra Madre cards this doesn&apos;t cause an issue, only because you can&apos;t find those cards anywhere but for sale or in containers. Unfortunately the new script screws things up MAJORLY for cards you find in the world, i.e. every single Sierra Madre card you&apos;re liable to come across.
The short of it is that when you pick up a card you find in the world it isn&apos;t added to your deck automatically. Picking the card up and dropping it again doesn&apos;t help; the only way to get the card into your deck is to transfer it to a container, then take it back into your inventory. At that point the card will be added as normal.
An additional complication is added due to the new &apos;&apos;Dead Man&apos;s Hand&apos;&apos; challenge. Because you are able to drop cards and pick them back up again, it is possible to pick up one card that is part of the challenge, then drop it and pick it up four more times. This will cause the game to count the challenge as completed, even though you&apos;ve only grabbed the one card.
This bugfix corrects the script so that it adds Caravan cards found in the world to your deck IMMEDIATELY. As a consequence, this also closes the exploit relating to the &apos;&apos;Dead Man&apos;s Hand&apos;&apos; perk described above.
As a side effect, the noise made when picking up a Caravan card will change from the standard item pickup noise to the &apos;&apos;can&apos;t activate&apos;&apos; noise. Unfortunately there&apos;s nothing I can do about that.</thetext>

Note: Cyberlazy, the author of the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43915]CASE[/url] mod, has released a compatability patch for CFW use with CASE. Use of that mod will add a ton of different ammo subtypes to your game so be sure to have a look at it.
Classic Fallout Weapons - New Vegas v3
Welcome to the New Vegas version of Classic Fallout Weapons!
This mod injects scores of classic weapons into New Vegas with new sounds and classic ammo. Iron sights have been set for all appropriate weapons and the meshes have variations for showing (most) weapon mods. Mods added by CFW require the player to convert a vanilla kit at the workbench with recipes built in. Recipes have been added as appropriate so you can craft the new ammo as well as the old. Weapons have been added to the lists, allowing them to advance challenges, work with perks and be used by Super Mutants.
If you enjoy this mod please consider endorsing it. I don\&apos;t get paid for this so endorsements and Kudos are my only reward. It also helps gain exposure for the mod. More people playing means more feedback, which leads to more data for me to make improvements and tweaks with.

That\&apos;s 63 weapons injected into your game, plus variations from mods. They will spawn on NPCs who will shoot you with them. You will find them as you explore the Mojave and you can buy them from various vendors you meet in your travels. The leveled lists put appropriate weapons in the proper hands and scale them for level.
================
Optional Plugins
================
Current patches include all official DLC mods (including an all-in-one patch for those who have all five) and a patches for FOOK and Project Nevada\&apos;s Equipment module..
===============
FAQ
===============
Q: The &lt;insert weapon here&gt; is chambered wrong. It should use &lt;insert real world ammunition here&gt;.
A: Ok, not really a question but it comes up often enough to be listed. CFWNV Adds the classic weapons as true to form as possible. The weapons are (with a few needed exceptions) chambered to use the ammo they used in the game they appeared in, not what they use in the real world. Thus the 7.62 M249, the .303 M14 and 10mm P90. This can also be adopted to address similar nitpicks that a weapon is listed by the wrong name, or company or whatever other detail that differs from the real world. This.. is... Fallout!
Q: Does this mod put all the weapons somewhere in Goodsprings and call it a day?
A: Clearly answered above, but no.. it does not. Weapons are spawned on your enemies, at vendors and looted from containers. And no, I will not create a version that dumps them all somewhere to make life easier. If you must cheat use the codes in the weapon guide (included in the download).
Q: Some of the weapons look too clean, can we get 350 year old beaters instead?
A: No. The Gun Runners and Van Graffs actively manufacture firearms and energy weapons, so that weapon can look as shiny and new as it wishes. Unless you\&apos;d like to be part of the solution instead of the problem and contribute a better texture.
Q: Any plans to improve &lt;insert weapon here&gt;\&apos;s textures?
A: Possibly. But keep in mind this mod adds a lot of weapons and so many textures add up on the download size quickly. I do not want the archive to swell to bursting, but I am open to improvements if you have texturing skill and would like to contribute.
Q: Can I make a compatibility patch that will allow people to use this and &lt;insert other mod here&gt;?
A: Run it by me first but most likely yes, compatibility is a good thing.
Q: Can I release a version of this that &lt;insert changes/tweaks here&gt;?
A: You can ask, but chances are very good the answer will be no. Not only does this mod use a lot of outside assets (many of which I can\&apos;t grant permissiuon to use in the stead of their original authors) but I also care for the manner in which it is used as well.
===============
Requirements:
===============
Fallout: New Vegas!
Optional patches require whatever they patch CFW to work with.
===============
Install:
===============
1. Extract the files from the archive.
2. Copy files to (install folder)\\Fallout New Vegas\\Data\\
3. Start Fallout NV Launcher, click \&apos;Data Files\&apos;, place a checkmark beside the .esm file. If you want the tweaks, check the optional esp as well.
=== OR === === Recommended ===
1. Install via Fallout Mod Manager
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901
===============
Un-Install:
===============
1. Start Fallout NV Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esm (and .esp(s) if used) file(s).
2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.
=== OR === === Recommended ===
1. Disable mod in Fallout Mod Manager
===============
Compatibility:
===============
This mod is incompatible with mods that alter Leveled Item lists specific to weapon and ammunition distribution. It does not alter game settings so most of the popular tweaks, weather and interior mods will be fine. It also works fine with mods that deal strictly with vanilla assets such as WME, WMX  and Arenovalis\&apos; weapon retextures. If you are having trouble with a mod not mentioned here post it in the comments. I\&apos;ll see what I can do to either make it compatible, create a patch for you or let you know the two will never coexist in harmony.

[color=FF0000][b]NVEC COMPLETE[/color][/b] contains Reduce CTD + BugFixes + Enhancements + [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=45104]Mission Mojave x93[/url] all in one esm. Obviously you don\&apos;t need to run the others when selecting this one. This plugin is mostly a compilation of hundreds of different mods which massively reduces load orders. Not only does it contain all of that, it also has my own tweaks and inclusions which are more map markers to unmarked locations, companions gear are all shown in inventories so you can fully customize your followers however you wish, and my newest mod [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46045]Loot All Cars Trucks Golf Carts Vehicles[/url]. [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=45104]MM x93[/url] made by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Mod_Team-MM]Team MM[/url] and [url=http://www.ravenmodding.terminal47.net]Ravenmodding Team[/url] addresses floating items, discolored terrain, faulty terrain, broken navmeshes, inaccessible navmeshes, bugged meshes, clipping meshes, wrongly placed statics, gaps in meshes, and clipping objects. Most mods merged into here have either been fixed, designed for NVEC users, changed to better suit FNV, and/or expanded to all DLCs. For the full list of inclusions, click links a little lower to make sure you don\&apos;t have a plugin running that\&apos;s already in this esm. I\&apos;ve gone through great detail and time putting this plugin together so I hope you enjoy it :)
[color=00BFFF][b]NVEC COMPLETE + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as Complete but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url]. From NVCE\&apos;s description: The primary focus of NVCE is the alterations of NPCs, which range from cosmetic fixes, stat changes, inventory etc in order to comply with a strict principle of Fallout lore. The best way to think of this is as Fallout 3\&apos;s \&quot;Project Beauty\&quot; or the \&quot;New Vegas Redesigned\&quot;. Many of the issues addressed include terribly disproportional faces and wacky hair colouring (see pictures for more detail). Problems with faces clipping through masks or goggles for NPCs have also been addressed (ie. African American\&apos;s protruding lips cause clipping issues with Legion face masks). There are also problems with NPC inventories, and these have been addressed also. Although credit is where credits due; for most of the important named NPCs do happen to look reasonably created and far more distinctive than Fallout 3\&apos;s unique NPCs. However, there are still countless NPCs with unacceptable styles, such as bright hair, pale skin or just being plain ugly.
[color=00BFFF][b]NVEC BUGFIXES[/color][/b] is a separated esm from Complete which just contains fixes to activators, ingestibles, ammunitions, armor, cells, classes, containers, creatures, dialogue topics, doors, object effects, factions, fornIDs, globals, head parts, lights, leveled items, messages, base effects, misc items, notes, npcs, packages, perks, projectiles, quests, recipes, scripts, sounds, actor effects, statics, terminals, texture sets, weapons, and worldspaces. They all are my fixes and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=00BFFF][b]NVEC BUGFIXES + NVCE[/color][/b] is the same as NVEC BugFixes but with [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39325]NVCE - New Vegas Character Expansions[/url] integrated by me and NVCE made by [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/modules/members/index.php?id=1236116]Machienzo[/url].
[color=00BFFF][b]NVEC ENHANCEMENTS[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete and has been renamed from essentials. Contains improvements, changes, expansions, tweaks, reduced annoyances, and basically making FNV badass and how it should have been in the 1st place. It\&apos;s my enhancements and many many mod authors work mixed in. Mods included most likely have been fixed in one way or another by me. The whole list of inclusions are at the link a little lower.
[color=00BFFF][b]NVEC REDUCE CTD[/color][/b] is a separated esp from Complete that repairs [url=http://pastebin.com/X1Eakfup]errors/warnings[/url] in FNV and DLC ESMs reported by [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/34703]FNVEdit[/url]. This results in quests, loading worldspaces/cells, roaming the wastes, and basically running FNV in general with considerably less crashes. Many records contained in FNV have left over unused FO3 records which this plugin disables resulting in minor reduced loading times and increased FPS. This plugin is how this mod all got started and where my skills mostly are.
[color=00BFFF][b]NVEC EXTRAS - MCM[/color][/b] is an optional plugin made separately towards the Mod Config Menu. It requires the Mod Config Menu and NVSE. The list of inclusions are near the bottom of the description which is only the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=39997]FPS Weapon Wheel[/url] at the moment. THIS PLUGIN IS STRICTLY FOR MCM MODS ONLY
[color=00BFFF][b]MORE PERKS MERGE[/color][/b] is a version of Dree\&apos;s More Perks combining all his esps/esms into one esm. Includes More Perks, More Traits, More Perks for Companions, and all his updates. The fomod installation is designed to output the NO DLC and DLC as the same name. Check lower for proper installation.

[b][center][color=FFA500]NEW USERS[/b][/center][/color]
Thank you for choosing NVEC :)
Installations are packaged into 7zips. Any bugs you find with NVEC and the vanilla game please report them to the comments section. Tommy keeps track of all bugs reported by users so don\&apos;t be shy.
[b]THE DOWNLOADs[/b]
Each is contained in a 7zip:[list]
[*]NVEC Complete
[*]NVEC Complete + NVCE
[*]NVEC BugFixes
[*]NVEC BugFixes + NVCE
[*]NVEC Essentials
[*]NVEC Reduce CTD
[/list]
If you want everything install NVEC Complete. This has everything NVEC has to offer except POTG and it\&apos;s made into one esm file instead of three separate plugins.
If you decide that you do not want to install complete you can choose from which modules you want to install(Reduce CTD, BugFixes, and Essentials). But remember the following:[list]
[*]Install the same type for each module you install. That means if you use NO DLC for Reduce CTD you have to use NO DLC for the other modules you install as well
[*]Make sure you install the correction asset folders. Failing to install the correct folders for the mods can cause crashes. 
[/list]
[center][b][color=FFA500]MORE PERKS MERGED INSTALLATION[/b][/center][/color]
[list]
[*]Download and install all of [url=http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7909/downloadall.jpg]THESE[/url]

[list]
[*]Place Extras esp and menus folder into your FNV data folder

You can enable the HUD element manually by the following steps:
    Go to your (installdir)\\Data\\Menus\\Main\\ folder.
    Open hud_main_menu.xml file in a text editor (notepad or notepad++ will do fine).
    Scroll to the very bottom of the file.
    Just above the last line which should be \&quot;&lt;/menu&gt;\&quot; paste the following.
    &lt;include src=\&quot;fww\\weaponwheel.xml\&quot;/&gt;
    Your bottom 2 lines should now look like:
    &lt;include src=\&quot;fww\\weaponwheel.xml\&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/menu&gt;

*UPDATE 2*
Updated for AWOP 5.0, generally increasing weapon skill and strength requirements for M weapons. Requirements are often less harsh for the overhaul edition as the weapons aren\&apos;t as OP.
As I was creating [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=45565]compatibility for AWOP and Arwen\&apos;s Tweaks[/url] (including WMX compatibility) I found that there was no updated version of WMX compatibility for AWOP including all the weapons and with correct repair lists, etc. So I decided to upload this separately as I had to create it to complete my other compatibility patch anyway.
*UPDATE* - Added shotgun commando version and reduced lever-action shotgun crit in the overhaul version. Critical damage for multiple-projectile weapons is applied for each projectile that hits (unless you\&apos;re in VATS, there is a bug that requires a fix, Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition fixes this for vanilla shotguns). AWOP had the M shotguns all with high crits, sometimes as much as 32. This means that each projectile crits at 32, which is way OP. I missed correcting the lever-action shotgun in the last version. Also reduce the sawed-off crit slightly now.
The old WMX-AWOP patch is outdated and has received several requests for updates. I\&apos;ve uploaded two new versions, one that simply makes M weapons moddable and one that does this while also fixing several issues including godly aim with the guns.
New M weapons not included in previous wmx-awop patch:
ballistic fist
bladed gauntlet
chainsaw
hyper sledge
power fist
ravage\&apos;s bumper sword
ripper
shishkebab
single shotgun 12g*
thumping sequoia
Fixes some has scope / scope from mod issues, as well as some vats silent/mod required issues not taken care of in old wmx-awop patch
Some tweaked values multipliers for mods are fixed to reflect current wmx values
Does not overwrite unrelated values (the rebalance patch overwrites these values).
Uses correct repair lists (old patch made it impossible to use m weapons to repair other m weapons)
Fixes some dummy effects (letting player know what the gun does specially, extra crit damage etc.)
.223 pistol doesn\&apos;t replace that gun (both actual weapon values as well as within game, etc.)
*2 guns have different chambers in AWOP, and 3 weapon mods for these indicate the wrong chamber. The guns affected are the single shotgun 12g and marksman carbine .308. I would just change the gun calibers back but you\&apos;ll not be getting the right ammo with these weapons and the first rule is to do no harm. I\&apos;ve adjusted the names of the 3 weapon mods to stay somewhat specific but refrain from indicating caliber. No functionality will be affected, but these mods are used for other guns so it is important to know this. The weapon mods affected are listed below:
MOD: 20 Gauge Shotgun Choke - Renamed - MOD: Long-Barrel Shotgun Choke
MOD: 20 Gauge Sawn-off Stock - Renamed - MOD: Long-Barrel Sawn-off Stock
MOD: 5.56mm Carbine Extended Mags - Renamed - MOD: Carbine Extended Mags</thetext>

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.

5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.
================================
11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.

Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).

- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)

*UPDATE 2*
Updated for AWOP 5.0, generally increasing weapon skill and strength requirements for M weapons. Requirements are often less harsh for the overhaul edition as the weapons aren\&apos;t as OP.
As I was creating [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=45565]compatibility for AWOP and Arwen\&apos;s Tweaks[/url] (including WMX compatibility) I found that there was no updated version of WMX compatibility for AWOP including all the weapons and with correct repair lists, etc. So I decided to upload this separately as I had to create it to complete my other compatibility patch anyway.
*UPDATE* - Added shotgun commando version and reduced lever-action shotgun crit in the overhaul version. Critical damage for multiple-projectile weapons is applied for each projectile that hits (unless you\&apos;re in VATS, there is a bug that requires a fix, Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition fixes this for vanilla shotguns). AWOP had the M shotguns all with high crits, sometimes as much as 32. This means that each projectile crits at 32, which is way OP. I missed correcting the lever-action shotgun in the last version. Also reduce the sawed-off crit slightly now.
The old WMX-AWOP patch is outdated and has received several requests for updates. I\&apos;ve uploaded two new versions, one that simply makes M weapons moddable and one that does this while also fixing several issues including godly aim with the guns.
New M weapons not included in previous wmx-awop patch:
ballistic fist
bladed gauntlet
chainsaw
hyper sledge
power fist
ravage\&apos;s bumper sword
ripper
shishkebab
single shotgun 12g*
thumping sequoia
Fixes some has scope / scope from mod issues, as well as some vats silent/mod required issues not taken care of in old wmx-awop patch
Some tweaked values multipliers for mods are fixed to reflect current wmx values
Does not overwrite unrelated values (the rebalance patch overwrites these values).
Uses correct repair lists (old patch made it impossible to use m weapons to repair other m weapons)
Fixes some dummy effects (letting player know what the gun does specially, extra crit damage etc.)
.223 pistol doesn\&apos;t replace that gun (both actual weapon values as well as within game, etc.)
*2 guns have different chambers in AWOP, and 3 weapon mods for these indicate the wrong chamber. The guns affected are the single shotgun 12g and marksman carbine .308. I would just change the gun calibers back but you\&apos;ll not be getting the right ammo with these weapons and the first rule is to do no harm. I\&apos;ve adjusted the names of the 3 weapon mods to stay somewhat specific but refrain from indicating caliber. No functionality will be affected, but these mods are used for other guns so it is important to know this. The weapon mods affected are listed below:
MOD: 20 Gauge Shotgun Choke - Renamed - MOD: Long-Barrel Shotgun Choke
MOD: 20 Gauge Sawn-off Stock - Renamed - MOD: Long-Barrel Sawn-off Stock
MOD: 5.56mm Carbine Extended Mags - Renamed - MOD: Carbine Extended Mags</thetext>

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.
================================
11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.
- Fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations are by Joefoxx.

Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).

- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)
- Fixed tangent space for a range of weapon meshes.
- Fixed alpha-sorting issue on AER14 Prototype stock.
- Reduced chance of finding weapon mods in loot.
- Laser RCW, Plasma Defender and Recharger Pistol now affected by Energy Resistance (same as all other Energy weapons).

REQUIREMENT:  Download zzjay\&apos;s latest hairs!
Fh hair for fnv and fo3 conversion by zzjay
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45640
DESCRIPTION:
MotorRunner is dead and I own Vault 3.  There were some UGLY female fiends in there.  There were some UGLY male fiends running around in there also and in the mojave wasteland as well.  Like ckent007 did in his mod (Female Fiends: newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36000) I decided to change all that and in the process I went ahead and BEAUTIFIED ALL the FEMALE raider races.  I gave each FEMALE raider race all available eyes and some new hair using the Cazy Hair Resource by Cazy and the Fh hair for FNV and Fo3 conversion by zzjay.  Most if not all fiends are now Foxy Female Fiends.  
Like Corporal Betsy, you will not want to shoot them....but you might have to.....so at least now they will have better looking corpses.
Hair Resource Requirements:
Cazy Hair Resource by Cazy:
newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44009
Fh hair for fnv and fo3 conversion by zzjay:
newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45640
You only need the meshes &amp; textures from those unless you want to use their esps.
WARNING - Fh hair test ESP edits the raider races and will affect the NPC\&apos;s I have edited IF that esp is loaded at all.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOD IF YOU DON\&apos;T WANT MOST OF THE FIENDS IN THE WASTELAND TO BE FOXY!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOD IF YOU LIKED THE FIENDS UGLY RED EYES BECAUSE THEY ARE MOSTLY GONE!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOD IF YOU DON\&apos;T WANT THE FIEND BOSS VIOLET TO BE RELATIVELY FOXY!
DO NOT WONDER WHY I WOULD MAKE THIS MOD AND JUST ENJOY THE SHOW!
Nuff said.
CONFLICTS:
This mod WILL conflict with any mod that makes major changes to the raider races or the fiend NPC\&apos;s like this mod posted on 052812:
Playable Raider Races by crustytoeman
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46411
I did not touch inventories or factions or anything else but Traits, Faces, &amp; Headparts of almost every NPC that had 
\&quot;Fiend\&quot; in their BaseID.
Installation:  Put Foxy Fiends.esm and the esm depdendent Foxy Fiends NPCs Only.exp in your data folder and activate them.  DO NOT use the optional Foxy Fiends.esp with these files.  Use it or them, not all three.
BUGS:
Hair clips through the fiend helmets.....BUT....its kinda sexy.
Please endorse if you feel the female fiends in your game are now truly foxy.

ckent007 for inspiration from his many fiend mods.
Ladyhawke for reminding me that fiends are people to.
TheTalkieToaster for allowing me to give my patrolling hotties more friendly AI Packages!
CHANGELOG:
.6 - Added duplicate vanilla eyes to raider races to ensure Ling\&apos;s compatibility.
.5 - Added new hairs by zzjay to female raider races and then added them to some Fiend NPCs.
.4 - Separated Raider Race edits into an ESM for easy addition to other mods.  NPC edits are now in a dependent ESP.  Optional All-in-One ESP that will not be updated anymore included.  The Foxy Fiends NPC Only.esp can be merged into your bashed patch so this will NOT increase your load limit.
.3 - Gave Pretty Sarah Green eyes and made some dead fiends female because sometimes.... they come back.
.2 -  Found one fiend I missed.  Changed more NPC hair.  Made raider races playable.  Made all hair playable.  
.1 -  Initial release.

ATTENTION PLAYERS NEW REQUIREMENT FOR OLD UPDATE:
ksResource - 50s Style TV Camera by Kibblesticks
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35212
Fumofumo for the Cazy Hair Resource by Cazy:
newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44009
zzjay for Fh hair for fnv and fo3 conversion by zzjay:
newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45640
WARNING - This is an ADULT mod.  If you are not an adult it will probably stunt your mental and emotional growth.  IF you are an adult it will probably do the same but at least you are old enough to decide whether or not to take the risk.
Load Mod Requirements:
FNV Sexual Innuendo by admechanicus for adult animations
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36659  (MOST CURRENT HOTFIX!)
Lings Coiffure NV
http://www.moddb.com/mods/lings-coiffure-nv/downloads/lings-coiffure-nv-v42
(Although I used to use the old version from the Nexus because of Wrye errors with the latest version.  BUT, thanks to snarfies, I fixed the Wrye Flash error.  IF you want to do the same, then GOOGLE, \&quot;Long standing problem with Ling\&apos;s and Wrye Bash has been solved.\&quot;)
Foxy Fiends AND Raider Races Playable by tiger8u2 for the FOXY!
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46224  (MUST HAVE ALL MESH &amp; TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS for this mod!)
Make sure Foxy Fiends.ESM loads AFTER Lings.ESM and you can bash patch it as well.
(NOTE:  All the requirements above are necessary or you will see BALD women with no eyelashes.  Use FNVEdit to ensure NO other mods in your load order modify the vanilla races or some hair may not show up.)
NCCS - NosCo Companion System by NosRhyfelwr and Herculine
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38059 
(Great mod, but the basic functions are NOT used with MOST of the prostitutes.  I only borrowed some factions to get ONE working girl at a time to follow the PC around.  There ARE a few NPC\&apos;s I added with NCCS in their name that CAN work as companions, but then they won\&apos;t be around where they came from to purchase services if you know what I mean.)
(OPTIONAL MAC - NOSCO Patch esp provided to lower the priority of NOSCO GREETING\&apos;S from 95 to 15 like most dialogue quests because that high of a priority interfere\&apos;s with MAC GREETING\&apos;S.  It will also prevent normal NosCo dialogue from showing up on recruited working girls.  It will bash into your bashed patch and again, all it does is exclude the normal NCCS dialogue from showing up on hired stable prostitutes as well as allowing other faction GREETINGS to show up on NPCs with the NCCSCompanion Faction.)
WARNING - Lings.ESM &amp; Foxy Fiends.ESM, Nosco Companion System.ESM &amp; Wsex.ESM, are totally required to play this mod.   IF you don\&apos;t have any one of them in your load order you WILL crash when you try to load with this mod active in your load order.  Nuff said.
Smalltalk by Kaeser allows you to talk to almost ANY NPC without getting the normal GOODBYE greeting:  http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41815. 
Recommended Load Order:
FalloutNV.esm
Lings.esm
FoxyFiends.esm
Nosco Companion System.esm
Wsex.esm
MAC.esm
smalltalk.esp
Description:
Rumbleskin stopped working on the More Adult Content - So You Wanna Be A Porn Star mod (http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36759) and indicated that if anyone wanted to pick up where he left off to feel free. 
I\&apos;ve reworked the quest a bit and fixed it so that ALL interactions with the prostitutes use ADULT animations from FNV SI.  
 This is the \&quot;He Man Woman Hater\&apos;s\&quot; version.  No Man-Ho\&apos;s just working girls and MOST actually WORK when the player is in the same cell or nearby.  (Will be adding more interactions as we go.)
There is dialogue which allows the player to \&quot;recruit\&quot; said girls into a stable AND reap the benefits of them working for the player directly.  (You can have any number of girls in your \&quot;stable\&quot; but can only pimp ONE out at any given time.)
I\&apos;ve also merged in several of my other Adult quest mods so I can work on ALL issues found by players in my mods at the same time so to speak.  They ALL add more adult content so in my mind they belong together under one roof.  I\&apos;ve also been wanting to use some of the resources I used in them in MAC, ESPECIALLY, the shower animation.  =)
Installation:
DELETE the old MAC.esp if you have it in your load order and make a CLEAN SAVE.  
Drop the MAC.ESM into your data file and make sure you have all the other required ESMs.
Make sure your load order is good with Wrye Flash or FOMM, etc.
Run the Wrye Flash Bash Patcher if you want but be sure that Ling\&apos;s and Foxy Fiends ESMs are both bash tagged for eyes, hair &amp; graphics.
Play the mod.  =)
Change Log:
2.4 - Disabled some Maria quest items/NPC\&apos;s and added enabling script during certain quest stages.  Thanks to Ozlander for catching that.
2.3 - Fixed Wolfhorn Quest Stage dialogue to get them to work when player pays.
2.2 - Fixed Cathouse Quest Stage that was not getting set properly.
2.1 - Fixed Boulder quest stage the kept dialogue from showing up.  Added dialogue factions to Cell Block 6 hostage.
2.0 - Removed a wsexQuest AI PKG edit.  Worked on Wolfhorn quest stages.
1.9 - Fixed quest dialogue so Dynasty says her part.  Thanks Nappy.  =)  Worked on silly stretching turrets.  Added customers for Mistress K\&apos;s Pleasure Palace.  Wrote a couple of container scripts to hopefully pay the player about 100 caps per day as their cut from each brothel.  Not too much...not too little.  
1.8 - Removed broken follower scripts.  Added good scripts to a few NPC\&apos;s with NCCS in their name.  Worked on broken quest dialogue found by Nappy.
1.7 - Fixed token scripts that were missing an IsActor statement.
1.6 - Fixed Pleasure Palace navmesh.  
1.5 - Fixed quest dialogue and packages for Mistress K, got rid of floating turrets,  added super special area and monster killing quest for the Pleasure Palace.  Finished Cat &amp; Mouse quest.  Involved Dynasty in questline.
1.4 - Fixed issue with MatchRace by replacing NPC\&apos;s with new NPC\&apos;s that have the race/hair I want them to.  Had to redo a ton of PKG\&apos;s to get the Queen Fiend post quest sex play dialogue to work with the new NPC\&apos;s.  If you wanted CLEAN NPC\&apos;s down there, well, here you go.
1.3 - Fixed a quest dialogue script that was supposed to give the PC something and didn\&apos;t.  Worked on Queen Fiend activator scripts.  Tried to get MatchRace to work like I want it, but it still doesn\&apos;t yet. Put a radio in the Queen\&apos;s Den.
1.2 - Fixed an incorrect ENABLE state that was preventing PC from finding a quest item.
1.1 - Fixed stages in Cat &amp; Mouse quest.  Fixed floating turret issue.
1.0 is HERE! - Merged in several of my ADULT oriented mods to allow me to work on all of them at the same time in the same mod.  Worked on connecting the \&quot;stories\&quot; of each of the mods.  Used BNB mesh resources and other sexy outfit mod resources to add interesting attire to the NPC\&apos;s.  Added male prostitutes.  Built a better mouse trap.
.9 - Fixed issues with Post Main Quest quest.  Added PC \&quot;working\&quot; at Golden Globe dialogue.
.8 - Added more to the Post Main Quest quest.  Changed camera to a talking activator that the player can use to \&quot;stage\&quot; GG sex scenes.
.7 - Removed working AI packages from GG girls, (I have a better idea for them).  Added more post quest sex dialogue to Lenny, Eddie &amp; the girls.  Added a small post pornstar quest quest.
.6 - Fixed Novac Girls not having working packages, Added working packages to The Strip girls, Added a 50\&apos;s Style Camera to the Golden Globes &amp; a Porn TV for future implementation.
.5 - Added working packages to Mormon Fort ladies and added conditions that require NPC\&apos;s to have enough caps to purchase pleasure when PC is pimping the girls.
.4 - Reworked some Golden Globe AI packages to prevent crashes.  Kudos to mchashbrowns for catching that also.
.3 - Fixed Birthday Girls quest dialogue priority to ensure her Greeting shows up.  Thanks to mchashbrowns for catching that.
.2 - Fixed Ling\&apos;s issue thanks to snarfies.  Added sharing with prostitutes that you are actually pimping.
.1 - Initial Release
BUGS &amp; CONFLICTS:
Sometimes the adult animations of the \&quot;Client\&quot; NPC and your \&quot;Sex Worker\&quot; don\&apos;t start and I can\&apos;t figure out for the life of me why.  It may have to do with the NPC\&apos;s AI packages or other adult animations in the background.  Recommend only working your girl when no other adult animations are playing nearby.  FYI - Your girl will get paid regardless of whether or not the animations play. (This BUG may be mostly solved.  Needs tested more but I think I\&apos;ve got it \&quot;licked\&quot; so to speak.  Animations will still end abruptly if other FNV SI animations are active nearby.  This is a limitation of the FNV SI scripts and not his mod.)
Sometimes the Golden Globe stars don\&apos;t perform right.  Use my wsexQuest FIXER mod to fix the animations and then try again:  http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45740
Once you have the key to the Queen Fiend\&apos;s Den, you have to JUMP to reach the door to leave.  It\&apos;s fun.  Try it.  =)
This mod will conflict with any other mod that makes major changes to the RSCharlie cell or the exterior load door to RSCharlieDestroyed.
Major Differences between this and the original:
No Man-ho\&apos;s!  Sorry, but they grossed me out.  All of them went to Doc Mitchell and had sex-change operations.  IF you want to think of them as transexuals.....be my guest.
I still have plans to re-introduce a limited number of male prostitutes but they will NOT wear prostitute attire....unless you dress them that way.  (Which reminds me I need to add \&quot;sharing\&quot; to the player\&apos;s stable.  (DONE in 061812 updated ESM.))
GREETINGS are no longer \&quot;closed\&quot; meaning that the NPC\&apos;s can be affected by other mods dialogue, including, but not limited to my Art of Seduction &amp; Marriage Mod.  (plug there)  It also adds more variety to the various prostitutes\&apos; greetings.
All buggy SI Animation issues that I found were fixed.
Beautified all the ladies as best I could and gave them various colored eyelashes and better colored hair.  IF I missed one, please let me know.
Added an leg or two to the Maria quest.....AND.....added Maria.  I always wanted to meet her.  =)
Added more NCRF captives for the Powder Gangers or player to abuse.  Eddie &amp; his friends will have their way with an NCR Trooper captive if you don\&apos;t kill them first.  Each cell block now has a captive and an unused vanilla cell block was added.  After the NCR Attack to retake the compound, three female NCR Trooper Captives will also magically appear, no matter who wins.  Other non-hostile Powder Gangers will respawn to enjoy them.
Added the unused NPC \&quot;Atomic Mini\&quot; to the Lucky 38 but changed her race to Asian Raider. 
Renamed quests, consolidated Idle markers, reworked dialogue.
Renamed NPC\&apos;s to remove the quaint but aesthetically offensive moniker\&apos;s that were unnecessary to provide the abundant \&quot;adult\&quot; ambiance the original mod offered.
Removed ALL major deletions and needless edits of all cells affected by the mod to improve compatibility with other mods editing the same cell or area.  (Sorry, the couches in the Atomic are gone.  I moved Star to the left of the stage and Ida is off the stage now so that the Atomic Rock Band mod isn\&apos;t affected.)(Yes.....I modded that mod to make all the musicians female.) 
Lowered the \&quot;stage\&quot; in the McCarren terminal that the ladies never used anyway.  Moved it back a bit and \&quot;recovered\&quot; some vanilla chairs.
Added \&quot;working\&quot; AI packages to most of the ladies.  (Still WIP)  Stand around the Atomic Wrangler or the McCarren Terminal long enough and you will see what I mean.  Even the Goodsprings ladies have visitors......Easy Pete might even be one of them but I\&apos;ve never waited around to watch for some reason.  =P
Added a couple of prostitutes to Primm outside The Bison Steve Hotel.  Their \&quot;working\&quot; packages don\&apos;t work till you get a sheriff for Primm.
Added post \&quot;So You wanna be a pornstar\&quot; quest dialogue to allow \&quot;practice\&quot; with both of the female pornstars.  Of course, they ARE \&quot;working\&quot; prostitutes, so......do as you will with them, or just watch, your choice. 
Added post \&quot;So You wanna be a pornstar\&quot; quest dialogue to allow PC to get paid for staring in additional porn videos and to make porn video deliveries to Mich &amp; Ralph. The pay is not so extravagant as to make this mod a cheat.
Added a BOS sex dialogue for female NPC\&apos;s only, which is actually what gave me the idea for my Art of Seduction &amp; Marriage mod.  (plug)
CHANGES IN UPCOMING UPDATE TBD:
Merged in my Prospector Saloon Night Shift vendor mod which adds a night shift vendor named Dynasty who wears a Cowboy\&apos;s Cheerleader outfit to the Prospector Saloon.  She has a small back-story atm and carries quite a bit more than Trudy does.
Merged in my FNV Cougar\&apos;s sex quest mod that had players searching for and seducing certain NPC\&apos;s of advanced age who usually disappear from the game entirely or serve no useful purpose after some point in the game.
Merged in my Republic of Wolfhorn Ranch sex quest mod which dramatically altered and expanded upon Kieranbhoy\&apos;s Wolfhorn Prospector Ranch mod.  The quest hopefully allows the player to build a location for themselves reminicent of the Republic of Dave from Fallout 3.
Merged in my Queen Fiend mod which gives player an interesting local and friends to have fun with.  Gives the player the ability to become a member of the FiendsFriend faction so that the fiends will stop shooting at you.
Added dialogue to allow you to give certain NPC in the GommorahProstituteFaction the actual Prostitute class so that MAC dialogue will show up on them.  Don\&apos;t ask me why they don\&apos;t have the class they should, I just know I\&apos;ve found that the three dancers outside Gommorah were in the NCRGambler class.   Instead of editing the NPC, I just give players the opportunity to FIX this in dialogue.  (Was thinking about also allowing this for other NPC\&apos;s in certain classes....like ADDICT.....BUT.....I\&apos;m gonna test how well the initial dialogue works first before I expand it.)

(I am no longer working on this mod, If anyone wishes to pick up were i left off feel free)
In a post-apocalyptic world one thing is the same as it was pre-apocalyps,Sex sells. Resources to trade in the wastes are hard to come by, so whats a girl to do? If you guessed hooking then you guessed right. Girls are poping up all over the place trying to earn a cap or two to pay the bills and Easy Pete isnt complaining cuz he now has somthing to look at other then the desert. Another great addition to the wastes is the new Golden Globes Porn studio were dreams come true and anyone can become a Star
More Adult Content or MAC for short is a attempt to bring alot more life and alot more \&quot;Sexy\&quot; to the wastes by adding Dancers/Hookers and sexual content in the form of quests and dialog to all corners of the game. 
( I have started working on the next part of the porn star quest, It mite take a little while cuz i want to make it good, Please keep up the great endorsments as these make me want to work even harder)
remember to check back often as i try to update and add content 2 or 3 times a week
MAC will work with all other mods that change cloths and appearence. MAC should work well with the mod \&quot;Populated Casino\&quot; but atm there is alot happening in atomics with MAC so you mite get a little lag or pathing problems if you run Populated Casino on high and are on a older machine.
(The optional MAC using the Sexual Innuendo animations (Beta) out now. tell me what you think or if you find any bugs. Credit for the animations go to the creator of the Sexual Innuendo mod. This optional version is a beta test. All my npc\&apos;s should be using the new animations. If people like and endorse this version i will add it to all the npcs I Create.)
You need to have the Sexual Innuendo mod for the optional version of MAC http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36659 
The Main file still dosen\&apos;t need the Sexual plugg-in)
MAC 2.5 Adds Over 20 new Npc\&apos;s to the wastes in the form of Sexy dancers and hookers, You can find them all over,from the steps of the Prospector salon in Goodsprings all the way to NV. MAC also brings a make-over of The Atomic Wrangler with new dancers and hookers to satisfy your sexy needs. MAC currently has 3 quest added to it. The first is called \&quot;Looking for Maria\&quot; and starts in Goodsprings, The other 2 quests are called \&quot;Girl on the run\&quot; and the last is \&quot;Birthday girl got....\&quot;
MAC 2.6 The NCR are cheering! The USO is in town. Now the troops have something or someone to do in there spare time
MAC 2.7 The USO has come to Camp McCarran
MAC 2.9 Added the USO to many more spots, I have also started adding Male dancers and hookers. So far you can find a few at Atomics,Sloan,Goodsprings,Camp MaCarran and a few more
MAC 3.0 Porn Star Quest added
MAC 3.1 Better dialog in the Porn Star quest special thanks to Terralventhe for fixing and improving it. I also added another quest between Looking for Maria and Girl on the run to help people find the next stage
MAc 3.2 Adds a new location for the Golden Globes Studio - The Birthday girl quest will lead you to the location or you can just go find it behind the old fort in Freeside. 
MAC 3.3 Did alot more work on the new Studio
MAC 3.4 Looked at all the dialog of the dancers and hookers then fixed them up. Should also fix the problem were some people were not getting the dialog at all
MAC 3.5 fixed a bug I found
MAC 3.6 Added a little more dialog and a new dancer or 2.
This isnt the next stage of the porn star quest. Am still hard at work on the dialog
Part two of the Porn star quest is coming along slow but
steady
Still working on
-Voice acting
-Adding pathing to hooker dialog, Somthing like \&quot;Follow me to my bed and we can get it on\&quot;
-Adding more npcs to sexy up the wastes
-Quest for each hooker with there own dialog
-The next stage of the porn star quest \&quot;Anal Inception\&quot;
Mods that mite conflict with MAC
-Sunny companion
Install = Drop the esp into the data file
I would also like to give Wolfhound2 a big thanks for helping me figure out a crash issue i was having with MAC
A Big thanks to Terralventhe for all the help with the Porn Star Dialog (Anything in the dialog that you mite find strange is 100% my fualt)

WARNING - This is an ADULT mod.  If you are not an adult it will probably stunt your mental and emotional growth.  IF you are an adult it will probably do the same but at least you are old enough to decide whether or not to take the risk.
Load Mod Requirements:
FNV Sexual Innuendo by admechanicus for adult animations
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36659  (MOST CURRENT HOTFIX!)
Lings Coiffure NV
http://www.moddb.com/mods/lings-coiffure-nv/downloads/lings-coiffure-nv-v42
(Although I used to use the old version from the Nexus because of Wrye errors with the latest version.  BUT, thanks to snarfies, I fixed the Wrye Flash error.  IF you want to do the same, then GOOGLE, \&quot;Long standing problem with Ling\&apos;s and Wrye Bash has been solved.\&quot;)
Foxy Fiends AND Raider Races Playable by tiger8u2 for the FOXY!
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46224  (MUST HAVE ALL MESH &amp; TEXTURE REQUIREMENTS for this mod!)
Make sure Foxy Fiends.ESM loads AFTER Lings.ESM and you can bash patch it as well.
(NOTE:  All the requirements above are necessary or you will see BALD women with no eyelashes.  Use FNVEdit to ensure NO other mods in your load order modify the vanilla races or some hair may not show up.)
NCCS - NosCo Companion System by NosRhyfelwr and Herculine
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/38059 
(Great mod, but the basic functions are NOT used with MOST of the prostitutes.  I only borrowed some factions to get ONE working girl at a time to follow the PC around.  There ARE a few NPC\&apos;s I added with NCCS in their name that CAN work as companions, but then they won\&apos;t be around where they came from to purchase services if you know what I mean.)
(OPTIONAL MAC - NOSCO Patch esp provided to lower the priority of NOSCO GREETING\&apos;S from 95 to 15 like most dialogue quests because that high of a priority interfere\&apos;s with MAC GREETING\&apos;S.  It will also prevent normal NosCo dialogue from showing up on recruited working girls.  It will bash into your bashed patch and again, all it does is exclude the normal NCCS dialogue from showing up on hired stable prostitutes as well as allowing other faction GREETINGS to show up on NPCs with the NCCSCompanion Faction.)
WARNING - Lings.ESM &amp; Foxy Fiends.ESM, Nosco Companion System.ESM &amp; Wsex.ESM, are totally required to play this mod.   IF you don\&apos;t have any one of them in your load order you WILL crash when you try to load with this mod active in your load order.  Nuff said.
Smalltalk by Kaeser allows you to talk to almost ANY NPC without getting the normal GOODBYE greeting:  http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/41815. 
Recommended Load Order:
FalloutNV.esm
Lings.esm
FoxyFiends.esm
Nosco Companion System.esm
Wsex.esm
MAC.esm
smalltalk.esp
Description:
Rumbleskin stopped working on the More Adult Content - So You Wanna Be A Porn Star mod (http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36759) and indicated that if anyone wanted to pick up where he left off to feel free. 
I\&apos;ve reworked the quest a bit and fixed it so that ALL interactions with the prostitutes use ADULT animations from FNV SI.  
 This is the \&quot;He Man Woman Hater\&apos;s\&quot; version.  No Man-Ho\&apos;s just working girls and MOST actually WORK when the player is in the same cell or nearby.  (Will be adding more interactions as we go.)
There is dialogue which allows the player to \&quot;recruit\&quot; said girls into a stable AND reap the benefits of them working for the player directly.  (You can have any number of girls in your \&quot;stable\&quot; but can only pimp ONE out at any given time.)
I\&apos;ve also merged in several of my other Adult quest mods so I can work on ALL issues found by players in my mods at the same time so to speak.  They ALL add more adult content so in my mind they belong together under one roof.  I\&apos;ve also been wanting to use some of the resources I used in them in MAC, ESPECIALLY, the shower animation.  =)
Installation:
DELETE the old MAC.esp if you have it in your load order and make a CLEAN SAVE.  
Drop the MAC.ESM into your data file and make sure you have all the other required ESMs.
Make sure your load order is good with Wrye Flash or FOMM, etc.
Run the Wrye Flash Bash Patcher if you want but be sure that Ling\&apos;s and Foxy Fiends ESMs are both bash tagged for eyes, hair &amp; graphics.
Play the mod.  =)
Change Log:
2.4 - Disabled some Maria quest items/NPC\&apos;s and added enabling script during certain quest stages.  Thanks to Ozlander for catching that.
2.3 - Fixed Wolfhorn Quest Stage dialogue to get them to work when player pays.
2.2 - Fixed Cathouse Quest Stage that was not getting set properly.
2.1 - Fixed Boulder quest stage the kept dialogue from showing up.  Added dialogue factions to Cell Block 6 hostage.
2.0 - Removed a wsexQuest AI PKG edit.  Worked on Wolfhorn quest stages.
1.9 - Fixed quest dialogue so Dynasty says her part.  Thanks Nappy.  =)  Worked on silly stretching turrets.  Added customers for Mistress K\&apos;s Pleasure Palace.  Wrote a couple of container scripts to hopefully pay the player about 100 caps per day as their cut from each brothel.  Not too much...not too little.  
1.8 - Removed broken follower scripts.  Added good scripts to a few NPC\&apos;s with NCCS in their name.  Worked on broken quest dialogue found by Nappy.
1.7 - Fixed token scripts that were missing an IsActor statement.
1.6 - Fixed Pleasure Palace navmesh.  
1.5 - Fixed quest dialogue and packages for Mistress K, got rid of floating turrets,  added super special area and monster killing quest for the Pleasure Palace.  Finished Cat &amp; Mouse quest.  Involved Dynasty in questline.
1.4 - Fixed issue with MatchRace by replacing NPC\&apos;s with new NPC\&apos;s that have the race/hair I want them to.  Had to redo a ton of PKG\&apos;s to get the Queen Fiend post quest sex play dialogue to work with the new NPC\&apos;s.  If you wanted CLEAN NPC\&apos;s down there, well, here you go.
1.3 - Fixed a quest dialogue script that was supposed to give the PC something and didn\&apos;t.  Worked on Queen Fiend activator scripts.  Tried to get MatchRace to work like I want it, but it still doesn\&apos;t yet. Put a radio in the Queen\&apos;s Den.
1.2 - Fixed an incorrect ENABLE state that was preventing PC from finding a quest item.
1.1 - Fixed stages in Cat &amp; Mouse quest.  Fixed floating turret issue.
1.0 is HERE! - Merged in several of my ADULT oriented mods to allow me to work on all of them at the same time in the same mod.  Worked on connecting the \&quot;stories\&quot; of each of the mods.  Used BNB mesh resources and other sexy outfit mod resources to add interesting attire to the NPC\&apos;s.  Added male prostitutes.  Built a better mouse trap.
.9 - Fixed issues with Post Main Quest quest.  Added PC \&quot;working\&quot; at Golden Globe dialogue.
.8 - Added more to the Post Main Quest quest.  Changed camera to a talking activator that the player can use to \&quot;stage\&quot; GG sex scenes.
.7 - Removed working AI packages from GG girls, (I have a better idea for them).  Added more post quest sex dialogue to Lenny, Eddie &amp; the girls.  Added a small post pornstar quest quest.
.6 - Fixed Novac Girls not having working packages, Added working packages to The Strip girls, Added a 50\&apos;s Style Camera to the Golden Globes &amp; a Porn TV for future implementation.
.5 - Added working packages to Mormon Fort ladies and added conditions that require NPC\&apos;s to have enough caps to purchase pleasure when PC is pimping the girls.
.4 - Reworked some Golden Globe AI packages to prevent crashes.  Kudos to mchashbrowns for catching that also.
.3 - Fixed Birthday Girls quest dialogue priority to ensure her Greeting shows up.  Thanks to mchashbrowns for catching that.
.2 - Fixed Ling\&apos;s issue thanks to snarfies.  Added sharing with prostitutes that you are actually pimping.
.1 - Initial Release
BUGS &amp; CONFLICTS:
Sometimes the adult animations of the \&quot;Client\&quot; NPC and your \&quot;Sex Worker\&quot; don\&apos;t start and I can\&apos;t figure out for the life of me why.  It may have to do with the NPC\&apos;s AI packages or other adult animations in the background.  Recommend only working your girl when no other adult animations are playing nearby.  FYI - Your girl will get paid regardless of whether or not the animations play. (This BUG may be mostly solved.  Needs tested more but I think I\&apos;ve got it \&quot;licked\&quot; so to speak.  Animations will still end abruptly if other FNV SI animations are active nearby.  This is a limitation of the FNV SI scripts and not his mod.)
Sometimes the Golden Globe stars don\&apos;t perform right.  Use my wsexQuest FIXER mod to fix the animations and then try again:  http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45740
Once you have the key to the Queen Fiend\&apos;s Den, you have to JUMP to reach the door to leave.  It\&apos;s fun.  Try it.  =)
This mod will conflict with any other mod that makes major changes to the RSCharlie cell or the exterior load door to RSCharlieDestroyed.
Major Differences between this and the original:
No Man-ho\&apos;s!  Sorry, but they grossed me out.  All of them went to Doc Mitchell and had sex-change operations.  IF you want to think of them as transexuals.....be my guest.
I still have plans to re-introduce a limited number of male prostitutes but they will NOT wear prostitute attire....unless you dress them that way.  (Which reminds me I need to add \&quot;sharing\&quot; to the player\&apos;s stable.  (DONE in 061812 updated ESM.))
GREETINGS are no longer \&quot;closed\&quot; meaning that the NPC\&apos;s can be affected by other mods dialogue, including, but not limited to my Art of Seduction &amp; Marriage Mod.  (plug there)  It also adds more variety to the various prostitutes\&apos; greetings.
All buggy SI Animation issues that I found were fixed.
Beautified all the ladies as best I could and gave them various colored eyelashes and better colored hair.  IF I missed one, please let me know.
Added an leg or two to the Maria quest.....AND.....added Maria.  I always wanted to meet her.  =)
Added more NCRF captives for the Powder Gangers or player to abuse.  Eddie &amp; his friends will have their way with an NCR Trooper captive if you don\&apos;t kill them first.  Each cell block now has a captive and an unused vanilla cell block was added.  After the NCR Attack to retake the compound, three female NCR Trooper Captives will also magically appear, no matter who wins.  Other non-hostile Powder Gangers will respawn to enjoy them.
Added the unused NPC \&quot;Atomic Mini\&quot; to the Lucky 38 but changed her race to Asian Raider. 
Renamed quests, consolidated Idle markers, reworked dialogue.
Renamed NPC\&apos;s to remove the quaint but aesthetically offensive moniker\&apos;s that were unnecessary to provide the abundant \&quot;adult\&quot; ambiance the original mod offered.
Removed ALL major deletions and needless edits of all cells affected by the mod to improve compatibility with other mods editing the same cell or area.  (Sorry, the couches in the Atomic are gone.  I moved Star to the left of the stage and Ida is off the stage now so that the Atomic Rock Band mod isn\&apos;t affected.)(Yes.....I modded that mod to make all the musicians female.) 
Lowered the \&quot;stage\&quot; in the McCarren terminal that the ladies never used anyway.  Moved it back a bit and \&quot;recovered\&quot; some vanilla chairs.
Added \&quot;working\&quot; AI packages to most of the ladies.  (Still WIP)  Stand around the Atomic Wrangler or the McCarren Terminal long enough and you will see what I mean.  Even the Goodsprings ladies have visitors......Easy Pete might even be one of them but I\&apos;ve never waited around to watch for some reason.  =P
Added a couple of prostitutes to Primm outside The Bison Steve Hotel.  Their \&quot;working\&quot; packages don\&apos;t work till you get a sheriff for Primm.
Added post \&quot;So You wanna be a pornstar\&quot; quest dialogue to allow \&quot;practice\&quot; with both of the female pornstars.  Of course, they ARE \&quot;working\&quot; prostitutes, so......do as you will with them, or just watch, your choice. 
Added post \&quot;So You wanna be a pornstar\&quot; quest dialogue to allow PC to get paid for staring in additional porn videos and to make porn video deliveries to Mich &amp; Ralph. The pay is not so extravagant as to make this mod a cheat.
Added a BOS sex dialogue for female NPC\&apos;s only, which is actually what gave me the idea for my Art of Seduction &amp; Marriage mod.  (plug)
CHANGES IN UPCOMING UPDATE TBD:
Merged in my Prospector Saloon Night Shift vendor mod which adds a night shift vendor named Dynasty who wears a Cowboy\&apos;s Cheerleader outfit to the Prospector Saloon.  She has a small back-story atm and carries quite a bit more than Trudy does.
Merged in my FNV Cougar\&apos;s sex quest mod that had players searching for and seducing certain NPC\&apos;s of advanced age who usually disappear from the game entirely or serve no useful purpose after some point in the game.
Merged in my Republic of Wolfhorn Ranch sex quest mod which dramatically altered and expanded upon Kieranbhoy\&apos;s Wolfhorn Prospector Ranch mod.  The quest hopefully allows the player to build a location for themselves reminicent of the Republic of Dave from Fallout 3.
Merged in my Queen Fiend mod which gives player an interesting local and friends to have fun with.  Gives the player the ability to become a member of the FiendsFriend faction so that the fiends will stop shooting at you.
Added dialogue to allow you to give certain NPC in the GommorahProstituteFaction the actual Prostitute class so that MAC dialogue will show up on them.  Don\&apos;t ask me why they don\&apos;t have the class they should, I just know I\&apos;ve found that the three dancers outside Gommorah were in the NCRGambler class.   Instead of editing the NPC, I just give players the opportunity to FIX this in dialogue.  (Was thinking about also allowing this for other NPC\&apos;s in certain classes....like ADDICT.....BUT.....I\&apos;m gonna test how well the initial dialogue works first before I expand it.)

Foxy Fiends
ver .6 WIP
by tiger8u2
06/08/12
REQUIREMENT:  Download zzjay\&apos;s latest hairs!
Fh hair for fnv and fo3 conversion by zzjay
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45640
DESCRIPTION:
MotorRunner is dead and I own Vault 3.  There were some UGLY female fiends in there.  There were some UGLY male fiends running around in there also and in the mojave wasteland as well.  Like ckent007 did in his mod (Female Fiends: newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/36000) I decided to change all that and in the process I went ahead and BEAUTIFIED ALL the FEMALE raider races.  I gave each FEMALE raider race all available eyes and some new hair using the Cazy Hair Resource by Cazy and the Fh hair for FNV and Fo3 conversion by zzjay.  Most if not all fiends are now Foxy Female Fiends.  
Like Corporal Betsy, you will not want to shoot them....but you might have to.....so at least now they will have better looking corpses.
Hair Resource Requirements:
Cazy Hair Resource by Cazy:
newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/44009
Fh hair for fnv and fo3 conversion by zzjay:
newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/45640
You only need the meshes &amp; textures from those unless you want to use their esps.
WARNING - Fh hair test ESP edits the raider races and will affect the NPC\&apos;s I have edited IF that esp is loaded at all.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOD IF YOU DON\&apos;T WANT MOST OF THE FIENDS IN THE WASTELAND TO BE FOXY!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOD IF YOU LIKED THE FIENDS UGLY RED EYES BECAUSE THEY ARE MOSTLY GONE!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOD IF YOU DON\&apos;T WANT THE FIEND BOSS VIOLET TO BE RELATIVELY FOXY!
DO NOT WONDER WHY I WOULD MAKE THIS MOD AND JUST ENJOY THE SHOW!
Nuff said.
CONFLICTS:
This mod WILL conflict with any mod that makes major changes to the raider races or the fiend NPC\&apos;s like this mod posted on 052812:
Playable Raider Races by crustytoeman
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/46411
I did not touch inventories or factions or anything else but Traits, Faces, &amp; Headparts of almost every NPC that had 
\&quot;Fiend\&quot; in their BaseID.
Installation:  Put Foxy Fiends.esm and the esm depdendent Foxy Fiends NPCs Only.exp in your data folder and activate them.  DO NOT use the optional Foxy Fiends.esp with these files.  Use it or them, not all three.
BUGS:
Hair clips through the fiend helmets.....BUT....its kinda sexy.
Please endorse if you feel the female fiends in your game are now truly foxy.

ckent007 for inspiration from his many fiend mods.
Ladyhawke for reminding me that fiends are people to.
TheTalkieToaster for allowing me to give my patrolling hotties more friendly AI Packages!
CHANGELOG:
.6 - Added duplicate vanilla eyes to raider races to ensure Ling\&apos;s compatibility.
.5 - Added new hairs by zzjay to female raider races and then added them to some Fiend NPCs.
.4 - Separated Raider Race edits into an ESM for easy addition to other mods.  NPC edits are now in a dependent ESP.  Optional All-in-One ESP that will not be updated anymore included.  The Foxy Fiends NPC Only.esp can be merged into your bashed patch so this will NOT increase your load limit.
.3 - Gave Pretty Sarah Green eyes and made some dead fiends female because sometimes.... they come back.
.2 -  Found one fiend I missed.  Changed more NPC hair.  Made raider races playable.  Made all hair playable.  
.1 -  Initial release.

Note: Cyberlazy, the author of the [url=http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/43915]CASE[/url] mod, has released a compatability patch for CFW use with CASE. Use of that mod will add a ton of different ammo subtypes to your game so be sure to have a look at it.
Classic Fallout Weapons - New Vegas v3
Welcome to the New Vegas version of Classic Fallout Weapons!
This mod injects scores of classic weapons into New Vegas with new sounds and classic ammo. Iron sights have been set for all appropriate weapons and the meshes have variations for showing (most) weapon mods. Mods added by CFW require the player to convert a vanilla kit at the workbench with recipes built in. Recipes have been added as appropriate so you can craft the new ammo as well as the old. Weapons have been added to the lists, allowing them to advance challenges, work with perks and be used by Super Mutants.
If you enjoy this mod please consider endorsing it. I don\&apos;t get paid for this so endorsements and Kudos are my only reward. It also helps gain exposure for the mod. More people playing means more feedback, which leads to more data for me to make improvements and tweaks with.
Here\&apos;s the list.

That\&apos;s 63 weapons injected into your game, plus variations from mods. They will spawn on NPCs who will shoot you with them. You will find them as you explore the Mojave and you can buy them from various vendors you meet in your travels. The leveled lists put appropriate weapons in the proper hands and scale them for level.
================
Optional Plugins
================
Current patches include all official DLC mods (including an all-in-one patch for those who have all five) and a patches for FOOK and Project Nevada\&apos;s Equipment module..
===============
FAQ
===============
Q: The &lt;insert weapon here&gt; is chambered wrong. It should use &lt;insert real world ammunition here&gt;.
A: Ok, not really a question but it comes up often enough to be listed. CFWNV Adds the classic weapons as true to form as possible. The weapons are (with a few needed exceptions) chambered to use the ammo they used in the game they appeared in, not what they use in the real world. Thus the 7.62 M249, the .303 M14 and 10mm P90. This can also be adopted to address similar nitpicks that a weapon is listed by the wrong name, or company or whatever other detail that differs from the real world. This.. is... Fallout!
Q: Does this mod put all the weapons somewhere in Goodsprings and call it a day?
A: Clearly answered above, but no.. it does not. Weapons are spawned on your enemies, at vendors and looted from containers. And no, I will not create a version that dumps them all somewhere to make life easier. If you must cheat use the codes in the weapon guide (included in the download).
Q: Some of the weapons look too clean, can we get 350 year old beaters instead?
A: No. The Gun Runners and Van Graffs actively manufacture firearms and energy weapons, so that weapon can look as shiny and new as it wishes. Unless you\&apos;d like to be part of the solution instead of the problem and contribute a better texture.
Q: Any plans to improve &lt;insert weapon here&gt;\&apos;s textures?
A: Possibly. But keep in mind this mod adds a lot of weapons and so many textures add up on the download size quickly. I do not want the archive to swell to bursting, but I am open to improvements if you have texturing skill and would like to contribute.
Q: Can I make a compatibility patch that will allow people to use this and &lt;insert other mod here&gt;?
A: Run it by me first but most likely yes, compatibility is a good thing.
Q: Can I release a version of this that &lt;insert changes/tweaks here&gt;?
A: You can ask, but chances are very good the answer will be no. Not only does this mod use a lot of outside assets (many of which I can\&apos;t grant permissiuon to use in the stead of their original authors) but I also care for the manner in which it is used as well.
===============
Requirements:
===============
Fallout: New Vegas!
Optional patches require whatever they patch CFW to work with.
===============
Install:
===============
1. Extract the files from the archive.
2. Copy files to (install folder)\\Fallout New Vegas\\Data\\
3. Start Fallout NV Launcher, click \&apos;Data Files\&apos;, place a checkmark beside the .esm file. If you want the tweaks, check the optional esp as well.
=== OR === === Recommended ===
1. Install via Fallout Mod Manager
http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901
===============
Un-Install:
===============
1. Start Fallout NV Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esm (and .esp(s) if used) file(s).
2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.
=== OR === === Recommended ===
1. Disable mod in Fallout Mod Manager
===============
Compatibility:
===============
This mod is incompatible with mods that alter Leveled Item lists specific to weapon and ammunition distribution. It does not alter game settings so most of the popular tweaks, weather and interior mods will be fine. It also works fine with mods that deal strictly with vanilla assets such as WME, WMX  and Arenovalis\&apos; weapon retextures. If you are having trouble with a mod not mentioned here post it in the comments. I\&apos;ll see what I can do to either make it compatible, create a patch for you or let you know the two will never coexist in harmony.

Overwrites nothing as far as I can tell so should be allright to go anywhere,it is a mod to call in vertibirds containing troops and air strikes/aerial support.
Appears to be fairly self contained.</thetext>

--------------------------------------- preface ---------------------------------------
I am a Japanese and am not good at English.
Because this Read Me translates it from Japanese into English by machine translation and writes it, 
I am sorry to begin that there may be the part which a meaning cannot understand.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This MOD adds the following.
  1.The new figure that I did it on the basis of Type3 Body, and improved the volume of a chest, buttocks, the leg.
  2.The equipment for vanilla which let a new figure support and one\&apos;s own equipment.
  3.The thing which I divided the equipment for vanilla, and allowed you to be equipped partly.
	Please enjoy pleasure of the wearing clothes one over another that I was not able to feel in the vanilla!
 Our Mod is changed to only the printing block of each equipment for women in a thing exclusive use of a woman.
 I undress even if I put the divided equipment on a man character and am not only displayed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equipment and all changed in this MOD added ADDON are in the box installed in GOODSPRINGS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN FILE

This is all the guy says about the mod. It alters most all of ceasers legion so I would assume it may conflict with any mod that alters AI or the legion soldiers. 
This mod will conflict with some other mods that alter NPCs such as Lings. 
Somewhere around the typical armor/clothing mods I would assume.</thetext>

This mod changes how the Pre-Order packs Weapons &amp; Armor are handled.
No more free equipment just after waking up in Good Springs.
Now the Weapons and Armor are added to the leveled lists as alternates of their generic equivalents.
Anywhere you could normally find say...a 10MM Pistol, you will now have a chance to find a 10MM Pistol, Reinforced or with Leather Armor you could now find a Leather Armor, Lightweight instead.</thetext>

Description
========================================
This mod changes how the Pre-Order packs Weapons &amp; Armor are handled.
No more free equipment just after waking up in Good Springs.
Now the Weapons and Armor are added to the leveled lists as alternates of their generic equivalents.
Anywhere you could normally find say...a 10MM Pistol, you will now have a chance to find a 10MM Pistol, Reinforced or with Leather Armor you could now find a Leather Armor, Lightweight instead.
========================================
Details
========================================
The equipments new names:
Weapons:
Weathered 10MM Pistol --&gt; 10MM Pistol, Reinforced
Mercenary Grenade Rifle --&gt; Grenade Rifle, Lightweight
Broad Machete --&gt; Machete, Broad
Sturdy Caravan Shotgun --&gt; Caravan Shotgun, Sturdy
Armor:
Lightweight Leather Armor --&gt; Leather Armor, Lightweight
Armored Vault 13 Jumpsuit --&gt; Vault 13 Jumpsuit, Armored
Lightweight Metal Armor --&gt; Metal Armor, Lightweight
Tribal Raiding Armor --&gt; Not included (Reason listed below)
And the Perks they will now work with:
10MM Pistol, Reinforced: &quot;The Professional&quot; and is now considered an &quot;Improved Holdout Weapon&quot;.
Grenade Rifle, Lightweight: &quot;Demolition Expert&quot;, &quot;Grunt&quot; and will also ignite gas traps on hit now.
Machete, Broad: Can now have poison applied and is added to the appropriate GRA challenges.
Caravan Shotgun, Sturdy: &quot;Shotgun Surgeon&quot;
Metal Armor, Lightweight: &quot;In Shining Armor&quot; and will no longer receive the benefits from &quot;Travel Light&quot; and &quot;Light Touch&quot; perks.
All equipment has been added to there vanilla equivalents repair lists.
The vault armor and canteen have not been added to the leveled lists but to the vault 21 gift shop store.
The tribal raiding armor however I didn&apos;t include because it uses the same mesh and texture as the raider blast master armor so I didn&apos;t see the point in including it.
Also the caravan shotgun has a script to fix the VATS critical bug that all shotguns have.</thetext>

[size=\&quot;5\&quot;]Description[/size]
The short version: watch the video. The long version; I became eagerly hate cloud-like hit effect on bloody organs so I removed that thing based on shubniggurath\&apos;s effects. I also adjusted Placement Radius so the blood won\&apos;t jut from the air. It\&apos;s not an enhancement but a matter of taste, so check the video for your decision. Ahem-! 
[size=\&quot;5\&quot;]Compatibility &amp; Installation [/size]
This mod merely tweaks three parts around organ hit data. 
Load it at the bottom order and test it if you whether want it or not. Not a big deal!

Description
=======
Ever annoyed by the fact that if you\&apos;d let your companions wait, they\&apos;d just stand there like a statue?   Ever annoyed by the fact that when they are following they seem lifeless?
Now you can make companions go into \&apos;sandbox mode\&apos;, which allows them to interact with the environment.
Your companions will walk around, sit in chairs, lean against walls, or even harvest a nearby plant or dead animal for food. And possibly some other things.
Also Companions will perform Idle animations when they are following you, unless you\&apos;re sneaking.  
Current Version 3.2: 
Adds a new sandbox package to all the companions, and allows you to activate it by talking to your companions and telling them that they can relax. 
They will respond to this with their own voice, and a little gesture that is different for each companion.
The advantage of this is that the original \&apos;wait here\&apos; command can still be used, so that your companions will still stand still if you need them to (for combat strategy reasons).
Version 3 is a complete rebuild with lots of additional features including; 
 1. There is no longer a distracting, and non-lore friendly initial prompt for companions to wear casual clothes, or keep there armor, this is now selectable through dialog, and can be changed at any time. 
 2. Different companions can be set to different options Veronica can wear casual clothes while Boone keeps his armor on.
 3. Companions now have a relaxed wear container accessible through dialog, so you can choose what they relax in! 
 4. Additional Idles while PC\&apos;s are following you. 
 5. Several subtle companion tweaks and bug fixes, such as giving ED-E light step. 
 6. Now has separate sandbox packages for sneak mode. Companions will no longer randomly stand up while sneaking. 
7. ED-E can play Radio New Vegas
A Huge thanks to Povuholo without his Companion Sandbox mode, and permission this would not have been possible. check out his original mod here:

Thank you SavevsDM  for the idea to give ED-E the  light step perk: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35526
Thank you jim_uk for the idea to do companion idles:

Installation
=======
1. Extract the Companion Sandbox Mode3.esp and Sound folder to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data folder. Select \&apos;yes\&apos; if it asks to overwrite.
2. Start the New Vegas Launcher (Or use a mod manager like NMM), click \&apos;Data Files\&apos; and place a checkmark beside the Companion Sandbox Mode3.esp.
3. Play the game! It may take a couple of seconds for the new topic to show up the first time.
(In)compatibility
===============
V3.1: This version may be incompatible with mods that change something about companions. 
When in doubt, load the other mod later than this one (so that one will definitely work) and then see if using the relax dialogue topic still makes the companions go into sandbox mode.
If your companion just stands still right there when you tell them to relax, or they start walking home, it\&apos;s very likely there\&apos;s a conflict with that other mod that alters the companion.
It should be possible to merge changes that other mods make to the companions with FNVEdit, if you know how.
Known Issues or Bugs
====================
This is a BETA please contact the author for any major bugs.
SAVE~!!,  Save frequently, save often, and not in the same save file!  This is important for all mods!
Items will \&quot;dissapear\&quot; out of a characters inventory when they are sandboxing. This isn\&apos;t so much a bug as they put it in a container.  Just tell them to follow you, and the items should come back. If anyone has any problems otherwise. 
 If you do think you lost any items just use the console COC companioncell.   There are containers for each persons gear, and dummy models that hold the test clothes.  
If your companion stands perfectly still all the time when told to relax, or starts walking home, this is because of a mod conflict.
Companions can use all kinds of furniture and \&apos;idle markers\&apos;. This means they can sit in chairs, lean against a wall, or hang over a counter, 
but they can also do strange things. Like gardening, taking over the barman\&apos;s job of cleaning plates, or other things you wouldn\&apos;t expect. 
There isn\&apos;t much that can be done about this, but it\&apos;s all fairly harmless (and funny sometimes).

Permissions
===============
If you would like to re-use any part of this mod. You must do 3 things: 
1. Credit Tyron1234, and  Povuholo, for companion sand box pieces. Credit, SavevsDM for the idea of giving ED-E light step perk, and credit jim_uk for adding idles to the companion packages. (Mods take hours and hours to make, and more to test give Credit!) 
2. Include relevant details from this Read-me or include this read-me as a document in your mod. 
3. Please notify me of what your doing! This isn\&apos;t asking permission, I just would like to be told what this is being used for and where (again this mod took a lot of work please be considerate)

Suggestions for Debugging a Mod
---------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
These suggestions apply to almost all Mods so please read them before asking for help. 
Check 1: Did the mod install right?  
Check to make sure you followed all of the installation instructions the mod author provided and that all of the resource files ended up in the correct place inside your data directory. Missing resource files can cause mods to not work. 
CHECK 2:  Is your game Updated?
 Make sure you are running an up to date version of New Vegas.  Most mods are written with newer patched versions and in some cases require those newer versions.  You can easily find instructions for how to update your game using Steam, D2D etc. for whichever way you bought the game. 
CHECK 3:  Mod Conflicts
   3.A  Look for Mod Conflicts 
 See if you have any other mods changing the same companion/item/value etc the program FNVEdit is great for that
http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703
FNVEdit will by default try to open all the mods in your current load order and can show you any conflicts that are occurring. There are lots of instruction docs on how to use it, it only takes 30 to 60 minutes to learn and is great if your serious about modding your games.
If you find conflicts but they aren\&apos;t impacting the same field you can often merge them to make both mods work. Example this mod changes Veronica to add new packages, a different mod changes Veronica\&apos;s face.  They won\&apos;t both work at the same time unless you merge them. 
  3.b Check your Load Order
Make sure you have things in the right Load order. A good way to check Load Order on a mod that is being weird is to try temporarily loading it as the very last thing. In all of Bethsoft\&apos;s gamebryo games (Oblivion, Morrowind, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Newvegas etc) whatever mod is loaded last \&quot;wins\&quot; in terms of conflicts.
If you load this mod last and it works, but you load it in a different order and it doesn\&apos;t it\&apos;s because of a mod conflict. In the case of this Mod it is ONLY impacting companions, companion dialogue, and companion packages so load order relative to other mods that change other things, weapons, landscape etc. shouldn\&apos;t matter.
You can also try some various load order solutions like \&quot;BOSS\&quot; etc. They work better on some mods and some games than others but if your using a ton of mods they are a good idea.
   3.C try disabling other Mods. 
 Most mod manager programs let you save out a list of your installed mods and their load order. Do this!  Then make absolutely sure you know how to reactivate that list. 
  Next try deactivating all of your other Mods except the mod your trying to debug.  If the mod your trying to debug now works, it was broken because of a mod conflict.  You can try reactivating mods one at  a time to identify the conflicting one or use NVSE as in step 2.A
CHECK 4:  Make a clean save and reinstall!
You can also try to make a \&quot;Clean Save\&quot; and then reload the mod. To make a clean save do the following:
1: Deactivate every setting in the mod your making a clean save for. In this case take every companion out of sandbox mode, If you\&apos;ve given them any special relaxwear etc take it back.
2. Save the game with all settings deactivated in a Vanilla Location. I.E. the standard lucky 38 suite, the Novac suite etc. not in a location created by another mod.
3. Exit the game and Uninstall the Companion SandBox mod, and Delete the .esp file
4. Reload the game and open the Save you created in Step 2. Save it to a NEW save slot. This new Save Slot is called the Clean Save (Yes I know it eats save slots but you can reuse them latter)
5. download the mod your trying to troubleshoots esp and install it again (this is because .esp\&apos;s can sometimes get corrupted resources can get lost etc.
6. Reactivate the .esp
7. Reload your game and cross your fingers.
CHECK 5:   Check the Comments/Discussion area of the Mod! 
Many times Mod Authors or even other users will have identified and answered common questions or problems in the comments section of a mod. Searching through it at least a couple pages BEFORE asking questions can save everyone a lot of time. 
If that still doesn\&apos;t work  either the mod you\&apos;re using may be \&quot;broken\&quot; or you may have to wait for another play through.  Sometimes values in Save files get lost, corrupted changed etc. and just don\&apos;t work right. One of the downsides to modding is there are so many costume builds out there that it just won\&apos;t work for some people.
CHECK 6: Contacting the Mod Author
Do this LAST not first!  While this mod has been beta tested extensively by myself and others i am always happy to hear about new genuine bugs.  When contacting any mod author to report a bug there are a number of things you should include: 
1. A very detailed description of the problem, exactly what isn\&apos;t working, what is working, when did it stop working, did you get any error messages, did you get  a Crash to Desktop etc?
2. When did you download the Mod and which version are you using. Some mods have multiple versions. 
3. What version of New Vegas are you using, Steam, D2D,  etc. do you have New Vegas Script Extend installed NVSE etc. 
4. If there is a conflict or problem another major Mod, DLC etc.  exactly which mod is it conflicting with and what resource is conflicting. Resource ID\&apos;s are fantastic .
5. Additional Relevant information,  I.E. your mod worked fine until I did quest XYZ then it stopped. 
Finally be patient and respectful Mod Authors have lives, and we don\&apos;t get paid for this stuff.</thetext>

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.
===============
5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.
================================
11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.

Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).
- Changed scope mod design for Brush Gun to accommodate shells being ejected from the top of the weapon if it has the Brush Gun Forged Receiver weapon mod applied; now uses scope from La Longue Carabine.
- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)
- Fixed tangent space for a range of weapon meshes.
- Fixed alpha-sorting issue on AER14 Prototype stock.
- Reduced chance of finding weapon mods in loot.
- Laser RCW, Plasma Defender and Recharger Pistol now affected by Energy Resistance (same as all other Energy weapons).

1. DESCRIPTION
===============
My Weapon Mod Kits (WMK) mod for Fallout 3 was the inspiration for Obsidian\&apos;s implementation of the weapon modding system in Fallout New Vegas; something which I am quite proud of and flattered by. I like Obsidian\&apos;s take on it; enough that I wanted to add to it... \&apos;expand\&apos; upon it, you might say.
Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) for Fallout New Vegas expands upon the base game\&apos;s weapon modding system in the following ways:
- ALL weapons get the maximum of three applicable weapon mods; this includes unique weapons.
- Unique weapons can be modified with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts.
- Some existing weapon mods (from the base game) are newly applied to weapons besides their defaults...
- But many more are weapon mods newly added by WMX.
- Some weapon mods can be applied to multiple different weapons.
- New crafting possibilities for the more low-tech weapon mods (mainly melee weapon mods).
- Some unique weapons without a common counterpart (for example That Gun and This Machine) receive one.
- New and altered art assets to visually depict most of the new weapon mods.
- Chance to find weapon mods in loot.
- More weapon mods available from merchants (to compensate for more types being available).
- WMX also contains numerous fixes for visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures.

3. MELEE WEAPON MODS
===============
Modifying melee weapons is a fairly different business to modifying firearms and energy weapons. Mechanically there isn\&apos;t as much to differentiate one melee weapon from another; not compared to the myriad potential differences between firearms, at least. With melee weapons, you generally swing at the enemy... and that\&apos;s about it; so you\&apos;re going to see a lot of commonality throughout the list of melee weapon mods below.
It would also be very unlikely to just find a custom grip precisely made to fit your makeshift plank with nails, or chunk of rebar and concrete - so with these things in mind, the crafting system becomes very important to melee weapon mods in WMX. For a large number of the weapon mods below, you won\&apos;t be finding them as-is. You will, however, be finding the parts you need to build the exact weapon mod you want.
For example, finding a hammer and a box of nails would allow you to make a \&apos;Bunch Of Nails\&apos; weapon mod to apply to a baseball bat (or a pool cue, or a rolling pin...). It\&apos;s worth keeping this in mind when browsing the list of melee weapon mods below. Also, check out the Crafting Weapon Mods section for more information on the crafting possibilities in WMX.

**These recipes also have \&apos;breakdown\&apos; counterparts; largely so that accidentally making the wrong one is not punishing.
===============
5. Requirements
===============
- Fallout New Vegas (patched to at least v1.4)
========================
6. INSTALLATION/UNINSTALLATION
========================
Please follow these instructions exactly. If you have not performed a step described here, or you have performed extra steps that are *not* described here, please don\&apos;t ask me for help if something isn\&apos;t working for you. I will not know what you have done, and therefore will likely not be able to help you.
***Tools***
These are useful - near essential, in fact - tools for using FNV mods in general (not just WMX). The instructions below refer to these tools.
- 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org)
- Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901)
- FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703)
***Installation***
- If currently using another mod that alters or adds to weapon modification of the vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas, UNINSTALL IT FIRST following the uninstallation instructions that (hopefully) came with the mod, and create a clean save (load your save game with the mod/s in question uninstalled, save your game again, and quit).
- Using 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org), extract the contents (everything - ALL files and folders) of the WeaponModsExpanded.7z archive file to your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory. If asked if you want to overwrite files and folders, click \&apos;Yes to all\&apos; (or equivalent for your operating system).
- In the Data Files section of the Fallout New Vegas Launcher - or using a mod manager tool like Fallout Mod Manager (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=36901) - place a tick in the box next to WeaponModsExpanded.esp.
- It is recommended to load WeaponModsExpanded.esp near the bottom of your load order - or at least after any other mods that edit vanilla weapons. You can change the load order of your plugins by clicking and dragging in FOMM.
- ArchiveInvalidation *may* be necessary if you have not performed it already. It can be performed with FOMM, or you can try this tool: http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35935
Upgrading from an earlier version of WMX:
- Simply overwrite the already-installed WMX files with the files from the new version, following the instructions above. You do NOT need to uninstall WMX first.
- Ensure that your load order is still configured correctly; updating plugins can cause your load order to change.
- Update your automatic merged patch (or create one if you haven\&apos;t already) following the instructions below.
- Load your game and continue playing.
Automatic Merged Patch Creation:
- This is strongly recommended as standard practice when using mods for FNV (especially a lot of mods at the same time), as it may improve compatibility between mods you may be using (including - but not limited to - WMX). If using more than one add-on for WMX at the same time (this includes compatibility patches), creating an automatic merged patch is even MORE important (assuming you want everything to work correctly).
- Download FNVEdit (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=34703) to create the \&apos;merged patch\&apos;. This should be done after you have installed and activated all the mods you wish to play the game with (and have configured your load order using a mod manager tool). This is how to do it:
- Run FNVEdit, and a list of all the plugins in your Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\ directory will come up, listed as per your load order. By default, the plugins you have activated in the New Vegas Launcher or in a mod manager tool will have ticks next to them. This is what you want, so just click \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished loading, right-click somewhere in the panel on the left that lists your activated plugins, and select \&apos;Create Merged Patch\&apos; from the context menu.
- Enter a name for the patch into the window that pops up (any name you like), and click on \&apos;OK\&apos;.
- Once FNVEdit has finished generating the patch (it creates a new .esp file with the name you entered), which should only take a few seconds, close FNVEdit. Click \&apos;OK\&apos; on the window that pops up to save the Merged Patch that was generated.
- Finally, make sure the Merged Patch esp is loading after all your other plugins (which it should already be, by default), and activate it using the New Vegas Launcher or a mod manager tool.
- If you ever uninstall plugins, update existing plugins, or install new ones, deactivate and delete the Merged Patch, and then follow these instructions again to create a new one.
Uninstallation:
RECOMMENDED: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any WMX weapon mods (or weapon mods that are not applicable to a weapon in the default game) that you have attached to weapons in your save game. At the time of writing the only way to do this is with The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515). Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. The alternative to using The Weapon Mod Menu is to follow the old-style WMX uninstall process detailed below:
IMPORTANT: Uninstalling WMX requires that you first remove any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from your inventory, and from anywhere you can access them in-game. Failure to do so will result in crashes to desktop. Follow these instructions:
- In-game, you will find an item in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy called [WMX Uninstall Menu]. Click on this item and carefully follow the instructions that appear on-screen.
- After uninstallation is complete, it is a good idea to create a clean save (by loading the save game and then saving it again) before doing anything else.
=====================
7. PLAYING THE MOD
=====================
No special knowledge is really needed to play the game with WMX installed; the new content is integrated seamlessly into the game. In case it\&apos;s helpful though, here\&apos;s a list of points of information regarding the mod:
- The new weapon mods are sold by the same merchants who sell weapon mods in the base game.
- The first time the game is loaded with WMX installed, two notes will automatically be added to your Pip-Boy that list all the weapons and which weapon mods can be applied to them. One list is sorted by weapons (it\&apos;s the list found in the Description section of this readme), so you can look up a weapon and see which weapon mods apply to it. The other list is sorted by weapon mod, so you can look up a weapon mod and see which weapons it can be used on. As of WMX v1.1, two more notes (in addition to the above two) will also be added. They are the same as the above two notes, but they cover Melee/Unarmed weapon mods instead.
- In WMX, all names of weapon mods have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos; - which means they will be helpfully grouped together in inventory menus.
- .223 Pistols are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;That Gun\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people armed with Service Rifles (as secondary weapons), and can be found in some stores.
- Battle Rifles are non-unique, less powerful versions of the unique weapon \&apos;This Machine\&apos;. They are sometimes carried by people that might otherwise be armed with Hunting Rifles, and can be found in some stores.
- In the base game, unique weapons can\&apos;t be modified, and many of them are in fact \&apos;pre-modified\&apos; with the same weapon mods that can be applied to their common counterparts. Where relevant, WMX removes these \&apos;integrated\&apos; weapon mods so that these unique weapons can be modified by the user with the same weapon mods as their common counterparts. This results in some unique weapons being slightly less powerful than in the base game when they\&apos;re unmodified, but *more* powerful than in the base game when they *are* modified.
- Hunting Revolvers are no longer scoped by default - but they (and the Ranger Sequoia) can be modified with a Hunting Revolver Scope.
- Riot Shotguns no longer have drum magazines by default - they have a box magazine instead, which holds ten rounds rather than twelve rounds. However, they can be modified with the \&apos;Riot Shotgun Drums\&apos; weapon mod, which upgrades their ammo capacity to twenty.
- Besides the various visual bugs in weapon meshes and textures that WMX fixes, it also fixes a couple of issues with Torres and Gloria Van Graff. Without going into technical detail, they would not sell items appropriate to the player\&apos;s level if the player had previously visited them at a lower level. In addition, Torres (and Michelle at 188 Trading Post, too) was not correctly set to sell Miscellaneous items (which include weapon mods), even though she had been given Miscellaneous items to sell.

8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)
===============
Q) I have a question I want to ask. Is there something I should do before contacting the author?
A) Yes. Please read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. Asking a question relating to something already covered in this readme will only waste your time, as I will simply direct you to \&quot;please read the readme\&quot;.
Q) I\&apos;ve discovered a bug and I can\&apos;t wait to tell you/the world about it!
A) This can\&apos;t be stressed enough. *Please* read the entirety of this readme through carefully first. The vast majority of the time, the bugs that are reported to me are known issues already described in the readme (usually caused by some element of the base game that cannot be changed - or just bugs in the base game itself), or are caused by conflicts with other mods (that can often be solved with proper load order management or the use of compatibility patches), or in some cases are actually intended features of the mod.
Q) Can I criticise you for implementing something in WMX in an \&apos;unrealistic\&apos; way?
A) Well I can\&apos;t stop you, but I might save you from wasting your time by telling you now that I won\&apos;t care. This mod does not attempt to be perfectly \&apos;realistic\&apos; - it is intended to expand gameplay in Fallout New Vegas; no more or less.
Q) I\&apos;ve got a weapon mod for this weapon but it\&apos;s not giving me the option to apply it. What\&apos;s going on?
A) It\&apos;s most likely a conflict with another mod that also edits vanilla weapons. Try loading WMX near (or at) the bottom of your load order, as noted in the installation instructions above.
Q) Help I can\&apos;t find the precise weapon mod I want for sale arglebargleblaaargh! Is WMX broken?
A) No. The weapon mods available from merchants (and found in loot) are determined randomly; and some are rarer than others. You may want to try the Mail Order Catalogs mod (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=39490), which has support for WMX and lets you order the exact weapon mod/s you want. As an aside, I was considering adding a similar feature to WMX itself - but then Mail Order Catalogs made that unnecessary.
Q) Can you tell me why I should use WMX rather than [other mod that expands on weapon modification in Fallout New Vegas]?
A) This isn\&apos;t something I can really answer for you; I\&apos;m obviously biased in favour of my own mod. I\&apos;ve provided a lot of information on what WMX offers on its Nexus page; both in the form of an exhaustive range of screenshots and in this readme itself. There should be more than enough information available for you to make an educated decision on whether WMX appeals to you or not.
Q) I\&apos;m having problems with FOMM/FNVEdit/ArchiveInvalidationInvalidated/etc. Can you help?
A) Probably not. If it\&apos;s not something that\&apos;s already covered in this readme, you would be better off contacting the authors of those programs (I am not affiliated with them).
Q) Is WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) It\&apos;s unlikely I\&apos;ll be able to give you a direct answer to this question. I simply don\&apos;t have the time or the inclination to investigate compatibility between WMX and the hundreds or thousands of other mods out there that may - or may not - conflict with it in various ways and to varying degrees. There are however a few notes in this FAQ - and in the Conflicts/Known Issues section below - that should help you work out compatibility.
Q) What about texture replacers for the vanilla weapons? Are they compatible with WMX?
A) They will always work (technically speaking), but may result in weapons that have their textures changed by WMX weapon mods looking different to their unmodified variant (in that the texture replacer only affects the unmodified variant). A compatibility patch will usually be required in such cases.
Q) Will you make WMX compatible with [insert name of mod here]?
A) In almost all cases, I only make compatibility patches for mods that I want to use myself. This means that requesting a compatibility patch for something will usually be pointless, since I\&apos;ll either already have done it if it\&apos;s something I want myself, or I won\&apos;t have time to do it. Not having time is the main thing: trying to make a mod compatible with all other mods is a sisyphean task... if the number of boulders Sisyphus had to push uphill increased exponentially each time, that is. (With every compatibility patch I made, someone would inevitably ask me to make it compatible with one or more *other* mods/compatibility patches.)
Q) Will you teach me how to make a compatibility patch myself, then?
A) I\&apos;m afraid this is another thing I simply don\&apos;t have time for. I highly recommend looking at the FNVEdit Training Manual (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38413), however; it should tell you exactly what you need to know, and do a better job of it than I could, I\&apos;m sure. FNVEdit may look intimidating at first, but creating compatibility patches with it is (in most cases) much easier than doing so using the GECK, once you learn the basics.
Q) Will you add the ability to remove weapon mods from weapons?
A) This functionality is available through The Weapon Mod Menu (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=44515), which is fully compatible with WMX.
Q) Will you add crafting recipes for *all* weapon mods?
A) No plans to do so at this time. Almost all of the weapon mods for ranged weapons - and many of the melee weapon mods too - are just too specialised and intricate to be cobbled together at a workbench from scraps found in the wasteland.
Q) Can you add more than three applicable weapon mods to a weapon - or the option to choose between two or more weapon mods to apply to a particular \&apos;slot\&apos; on a weapon?
A) No; the weapon-modification system in FNV has a hard-coded limit of three weapon mods per weapon.
Q) Why so few visible weapon mods for Unarmed weapons?
A) The short answer is \&apos;technical limitations\&apos;. The long answer is that weapons that conform closely to the hands (like gloves or knuckle-dusters) need to be rigged to the skeleton, meaning their mesh files need to be implemented via \&apos;armour add-ons\&apos;. These armour add-ons can only be defined on a weapon-by-weapon basis, rather than a weapon mod by weapon mod basis, meaning the mesh can\&apos;t be changed when a weapon mod is applied. This meant that a lot of the weapon mods for Unarmed weapons had to be ones without a visible effect on the weapon.
Q) What does \&apos;vanilla\&apos; mean?
A) In this context, it refers to things from the base, unmodified Fallout New Vegas game.
Q) Why am I seeing 3D exclamation points, flashing/swapping textures and/or missing texture notifications instead of items from the WMX mod?
A) This happens when the game can\&apos;t find the meshes and/or textures it\&apos;s looking for; in this case that means that WMX wasn\&apos;t installed correctly. In the case of texture issues - not missing mesh issues - it may also point to an ArchiveInvalidation issue. In both cases, please follow the Installation instructions above.
Q) I\&apos;m seeing floating revolver speedloaders, laser sights not switching on, strange behaviour with heavy weapons and their backpacks, etc. Is this caused by WMX?
A) No. In my experience (and in the reports I\&apos;ve had from users) this has been linked to the Pip-Boy Readius mod - and it will happen whether WMX is present or not. To make it really clear, this is not a compatibility issue between WMX and Readius; it is (unfortunately) an issue with Readius itself. See the Known Issues section below for other (vanilla) bugs that can cause similar issues.
Q) Will you tell me how to cheat to get the weapon mods so I don\&apos;t have to go looking for them?
A) There are console commands to give your character any items you want; and with a bit of research I\&apos;m sure you\&apos;ll work it out. I\&apos;m not going to actively help people to cheat at my mod though: it goes against the intended design of the mod.
Q) Why is the game crashing to desktop when I interact with this weapon, after uninstalling WMX?
A) This happens if WMX was not uninstalled correctly. Be sure to follow the uninstallation instructions above closely.
Q) Why is the game crashing on startup after I\&apos;ve installed this add-on for WMX?
A) This usually happens if an active plugin cannot \&apos;find\&apos; the esm/esp file/s it is dependent on - usually because these \&apos;master\&apos; files are absent/renamed/loading after the active plugin. WMX add-ons will almost always need to load *after* WeaponModsExpanded.esp (but follow the installation instructions for the add-on in question carefully), and WeaponModsExpanded.esp cannot be renamed.
===============
9. SAVE GAMES
===============
- Activating or de-activating this mod should not have any negative effects on your existing save game/s (provided the instructions in this readme are followed) - but as always, it is good practice to keep backups.
- Follow the Uninstallation instructions above if you wish to deactivate this mod. Trust me. This is important.
============================
10. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ISSUES
============================
- WMX is not compatible with other mods that alter modification (with weapon mods) of vanilla weapons in Fallout New Vegas. Such mods will need to be uninstalled before installing WMX.
- Mods that directly edit vanilla weapons will conflict with WMX. Compatibility patches are usually required in these cases. (Though in a pinch you might get away with just loading WMX after the conflicting mod, as noted in the installation instructions above.)
- Following the \&apos;Automatic Merged Patch Creation\&apos; part of the installation instructions (see above) will minimise conflicts between WMX and other mods (depending on the specific mod, as always).
- WMX includes fixed animation files that replace some vanilla weapon animations. These look identical to the vanilla animations, but fix several issues and include additional functionality used by WMX and its add-ons. If you are using animation replacers, they may be overwritten (partially or completely) when WMX is installed. Simply install/reinstall them after installing/updating WMX if you would prefer to use those animations. Joefoxx\&apos;s animations (http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=38527) should be useable with WMX without compromising the fixes/functionality in the animations included with WMX; Joefoxx is the one who made them, in fact.
- Addendum to the above: at the time of writing, the current version of Joefoxx\&apos;s animations seem to have an issue with the Laser Pistol (in WMX or otherwise). The simplest way to fix this is to delete this file: \\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\fallout new vegas\\Data\\meshes\\characters\\_1stperson\\1hpattack3.kf
- Aiming down the sights with the weapons given iron-sights by WMX (e.g. the Laser Rifle) may not work very well with the \&apos;True Iron Sights\&apos; gameplay setting disabled. To the best of my knowledge, this is unavoidable, due to the design of the weapon and the animations it uses. (On a personal note, I\&apos;ve never even *considered* playing the game with True Iron Sights disabled. It\&apos;s definitely my recommendation to enable it.)
- The modified variants of the Shiskebab are currently not using custom meshes, as they were causing some display issues with the weapon\&apos;s flames and backpack.
- At the time of writing there are several bugs in Fallout New Vegas itself that have an impact on WMX. These cannot be fixed by me: they will require a patch from Obsidian to fix:
- Applying an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod to a weapon that is currently fully repaired can actually degrade its condition. Any condition level besides 100% appears to be fine.
- It seems that modified weapons given to companions appear as unmodified weapons while they are carrying them.
- Changing clothes can cause issues with certain animated sections (e.g. laser sight beams, speedloaders, etc) of equipped weapons. Un-equipping and re-equipping the weapon will usually fix this.
- Speedloaders for revolver-type weapons can be incorrectly displayed lodged in the back of the weapon (but only in third-person) until the first time the weapon is fired/reloaded after equipping it.
================================
11. CREDITS
================================
- Any aspect of WMX not specifically mentioned here in the credits can usually be assumed to be the work of Antistar (Joseph Lollback - that would be me). In addition, many of the things mentioned here had additional work done to them by me. If you need to know nitty-gritty specifics for whatever reason, just ask me.
- Many meshes and textures included in this mod are \&apos;remixed\&apos; Bethsoft/Obsidian assets. They should be self-evident to anyone familiar with FNV, but if you\&apos;re unsure about the origins of something and wish to know, again don\&apos;t hesitate to ask.

Version 1.1 - The \&apos;Nails\&apos; update (06-09-11)
- Major content update:
--- Added weapon mods for Melee and Unarmed weapons.
--- Added crafting recipes for many Melee/Unarmed weapon mods - and for a couple of ranged weapon mods.
--- Added several new items to be used as parts for the above-mentioned crafting recipes.
- There is no longer the chance for .223 Pistols to replace Service Rifles in loot and on NPCs - instead there is now the chance for them to be found *as well as* Service Rifles.
- Further improvements to Plasma Rifle and Multiplas meshes by MadCat (glowing port holes).
- Texture set assignment fix for Lucky (HD Cyl + Long Barrel variant).
- Michelle at 188 Trading Post now sells miscellaneous items, as (it seems) intended by Obsidian. (This includes weapon mods.)
Version 1.0.9 (07-07-11)
- Behind-the-scenes changes in aid of compatibility with FNV patch 1.4.
- Weapon Repair Kits are no longer selectable in the repair menu for weapons, as the vanilla bug that made this necessary appears to have been fixed. (See v1.0.2 changelog, below, for more info.)
Version 1.0.8 (13-06-11)
- Increased number of WMX-added weapon mods available at many merchants.
- Increased price of most rate-of-fire-increase weapon mods added by WMX.
- Increased price of Plasma Defender weapon mods.
- Further fixes to issues with Torres\&apos; merchant inventory; she now actually offers better items if the player joins the Brotherhood Of Steel - as intended.
Version 1.0.7 (17-05-11)
- Numerous stat changes to weapons to bring them in line with the changes made in the recent official FNV patch (patch 1.3).
- Overhauled weapon mod prices to be in line with changes made in the abovementioned patch.
- Minor vanilla bugfixes to .357 Magnum Revolver and Lucky meshes (shells are no longer ultra-shiny/bright).
- Minor texture set assignment fix to Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia statics.
Version 1.0.6 (02-04-11)
- Behind-the-scenes change to how vendors stock the .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle; should be more reliable now.
- Added dedicated world models for modified variants of Grenade Machinegun and Mercy; fixes issues related to dropping them.
Version 1.0.5 (12-03-11)
- Added iron-sights to Tri-Beam Laser Rifle.
- Tri-Beam Laser Rifle now uses iron-sights correctly.
- Reduced rate of fire increase given by \&apos;.357 Revolver Custom Action\&apos; weapon mod.
Version 1.0.4 (15-02-11)
- Added iron-sights to Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes.
- Made various fixes to Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype meshes (mostly fixing vanilla issues left over from FO3).
- Laser Pistol, Pew Pew, Laser Rifle and AER14 Prototype now use iron-sights correctly.
- Added Joefoxx\&apos;s bullpup reload animations (not used in WMX main; resource for add-ons).
Version 1.0.3 (11-02-11)
- WMX now includes fixed/tweaked vanilla weapon animations by Joefoxx.
- That Gun is now visually distinct from the .223 Pistol.
- All weapon mod item names now have the prefix \&apos;MOD:\&apos;.
- Weapon mod item descriptions now describe Increased Damage as a percentage increase, rather than a specific integer; improves compatibility and also interacts better with things like ammo types that affect a weapon\&apos;s damage. Note that this change does not affect the damage increase gained from these weapon mods in any way.
- The above point did prompt a review of the Increased Damage mod effect values used by certain weapons, however. The following weapons had this value tweaked (increased slightly, in almost all cases): .44 Magnum, Mysterious Magnum, Anti-Materiel Rifle, Hunting Revolver, Ranger Sequoia, Light Machine Gun, Marksman Carbine, All-American and Recharger Rifle.
- In-game notes listing weapons and weapon mods updated to reflect the above changes to weapon mod item descriptions. Some minor tidying, also.
- \&apos;Fat Man Increased Pressure\&apos; weapon mod now increases range by 25% (down from 50%).

- Battle Rifle Long Barrel variant now uses correct third-person model.
- Vance\&apos;s 9mm Submachine Gun (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Minor mesh fix for Hunting Revolvers (better smoothing on cylinder).
- Corrected glow-dot placement on iron-sights in .44 Magnum (Heavy Frame) mesh.
- Improved Recharger Pistol iron-sight \&apos;zeroing\&apos;.
- Tweaked .223 Pistol/That Gun laser sight beam effect alignment.
- Reverted attack animation used by Recharcher Pistol to default (no longer needed to be changed, thanks to Joefoxx\&apos;s animations).
- Recharger Rifle now has its own repair formlist, rather than using the Laser Rifle one (Recharger Rifles can no longer be repaired with Laser Rifles, in other words).
- Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;WeaponRiflesLIST\&apos; formlist (meaning it now counts towards the challenge \&apos;The Big Squeezy\&apos;, like This Machine does).
- .223 Pistol added to the \&apos;PerkCowboyWeapons\&apos; formlist (meaning it is now affected by the \&apos;Cowboy\&apos; perk, as That Gun is).
- .223 Pistol (plus 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG and That Gun) added to the \&apos;TheProfessionalWeaponsList\&apos; formlist (meaning that these weapons are now affected by the perk \&apos;The Professional\&apos; - as they should be, according to the perk description).
- .223 Pistol and Battle Rifle added to the \&apos;NVAllWeapons\&apos; formlist (involved in being frisked for weapons).
Version 1.0.2 (31-01-11)
- Added Weapon Repair Kit to repair formlists of all ranged weapons as a workaround for the (vanilla) \&apos;degrade\&apos; bug encountered when trying to use a Weapon Repair Kit on a weapon that has been modified with an \&apos;Increase Max. Condition\&apos; weapon mod. See the Playing The Mod section for more information.
- Ranged weapons that lacked a repair formlist have been given one.
- Grenade Launcher has been given its own repair formlist (rather than using the Minigun repair formlist as in vanilla FNV).
- Ratslayer (unmodified variant) now uses correct world model.
- Non-\&apos;Improved Parts\&apos; variants of the Caravan Shotgun no longer semi-forced to use the vanilla Caravan Shotgun textures.
Version 1.0.1 (22-01-11)
- Fixed tangent space for a range of weapon meshes.
- Fixed alpha-sorting issue on AER14 Prototype stock.
- Reduced chance of finding weapon mods in loot.
- Laser RCW, Plasma Defender and Recharger Pistol now affected by Energy Resistance (same as all other Energy weapons).

Name: Perk Fix – The Professional with Dead Money DLC
Date: 10 Jun 11
Category: NPC
Requirements: Dead Money DLC
Author: Ogramirad
Description
===========
Adds The Police Pistol from Dead Money to The Professional and Cowboy Perk Lists.
Details
=======
There are two bugs with the Police Pistol listed in the wiki for The Professional Perk concerning the Dead Money DLC.
The Police Pistol: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Police_Pistol
The Professional: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Professional
The first one is, Despite matching the description of the weapons covered by this perk, The Professional does not affect That Gun or the Police Pistol.
Vorphs version of this mod took care of That Gun, mine takes care of the Police Pistol.
The second bug I dont have a freaking clue on how to fix as it requires being able to mod the script for The Professional Perk.
This mod also adds the Police Pistol to the Cowboy Perk as it is a revolver and should be on that Perk list as well as per the wiki.
Looking at the Cowboy Perk there are no bugs listed, as in The Professional Perk application for the Police Pistol.
It does not address the sneak attack issue with the Professional Perk, since the Cowboy Perk offers a straight up 25% damage increase sneaking or not.
The increase for The Professional only adds 20% when sneaking, and that does not work for The Police Pistol due to the scripting error bug.
So if you are like me, you will be glad to just take the extra 25% damage on the police pistol.
Those Ghost People don&apos;t go down to easy.
Install
=======
1. Download to a temporary location.
2. Copy files to (install folder) C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\fallout new vegas\Data (If that is your directory, if it is not you will have to find it. Lol )
3. Start Fallout New Vegas Launcher, click &apos;Data Files&apos;, verify there is a checkmark beside the ProfessionalListFixDeadMoney.esp file.
4. Or install it using FOMM
Uninstall
=========
1. Start Fallout New Vegas Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).
2. Delete the file associated with the mod:
Incompatibility
===============
None that I know of, as long as the mod requirements are used. 
Known Issues or Bugs
====================
None that I know of. 
As with any mod, a backup of your save game is suggested.
If you come across any please let me know.

Two modder\&apos;s ongoing quest for every misc item to have it\&apos;s own icon.

MISC ITEMS STILL USE THAT GENERIC SCRAP ICON.
We\&apos;ve made this mod  because it irritates us that a lot of the different misc catagory icons use the same generic junk
icon. We think you\&apos;ll really enjoy this, hopefully as much as we enjoyed making it.

Ammo Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New basic ammo types are as follows:
Incendiary: Creates an incendiary explosion on impact, and sets targets on fire.
Explosive: Creates an explosion on impact, Does massive damage to unarmoured targets, But has a DT penalty. Also great for seeing where your shot.
High Explosive: Creates an explosion on impact, Does massive damage and penetrates armour. Also great for seeing where your shot lands.
Tracer: Shows you the path of your bullet, in all guns! Most machine guns also only fire 50% tracers, So these fire 100%. See how accurate your pistol or rifle is.
Plastic: Less lethal rounds, Mainly do fatigue damage.
SWC +P: Like normal rounds, Only heavier, And packed with an overpressure powder load. More damage, Small DT reduction. Small weapon condition penalty.
+P: Like normal rounds, but packed with an overpressure powder load. Slightly more damage, small DT reduction, Small weapon condition penalty.
JHP: Jacketed Hollow Point: Like HP rounds, But with less DT penalty and slightly lower damage. Typical 2X DT and 1.5X damage
JSP: Jacketed Soft Point: Like normal rounds, But small DT reduction and small increase in damage.
FMJ: Full metal jacket: Like AP ammo, But with a lead core for more damage then AP but less DT reduction.
All Jacketed rounds also cause less wear to weapons then normal rounds.
Gas Cartridges:
Fuel: Standard flames.
Plasma: Blue flames that do more damage then normal fuel.
Liquid Nitrogen: Freezes the target for several seconds
Acid: Massively reduces Damage Threshold of target while doing minor damage over a long period of time.

Incinerator ammo:
Fire: Standard flame explosion
Plasma: More intense flame damage
Explosive: Fuel/Air Explosion. Does damage over a wider range but no lasting burning effect.
New energy ammo types are as follows:
Regulated: A built in regulator results in more consistent energy output, Resulting in less wear, and a slight improvement in damage output.
Modulated: Modulated to produce a longer, lower energy output that does large damage to flesh, but fails to damage armoured foes.
Pulsed: Micro pulsed output that is much better at defeating armour, Without the wear that overcharged ammo results in.
New 12Ga/20Ga/25mm/40mm ammo is as follows:
Buckshot: Wide spread, High damage.
Magnum: More buckshot, More powder, More damage.
Incendiary Slug: Explodes on impact producing a Incendiary explosion that ignites anyone caught in the blast.
Plasma Slug: Results in plasma explosion on impact
Explosive Slug: Detonates on impact producing an explosion.
High Explosive Slug: Detonates on impact producing a large explosion.
Lead Slug: Single slug of lead, High damage
Magnum Slug: An even bigger slug of lead and more powder, high damage.
Tri-Ball: Three slug like projectiles puncture armor better then buckshot with less spread.
Glass shot: Like hollow point buckshot ammo for shotguns. 3X DT and 1.75X damage. Great for Cazadors.
Flechette: Large number of small steel darts, armour piercing buckshot.
Mine: Grenade that does not explode on impact, but is proximity triggered. May be disarmed and recovered.
Remote: Remote detonated grenade, Detonated via &apos;Detonator&apos; Weapon used by C4 or by damage.
Cluster: Detonates on impact, releasing a number of smaller time delayed grenades. Massive damage.
EMP: Makes an EMP/Electrical blast that damages Robots and power armour users, And causes fatigue damage and temporary paralysis to everyone!
Impulse: Causes a controlled shock wave that blasts enemies away causing large amounts of fatigue damage
New Missile ammo is as follows:
Cluster: Detonates on impact, releasing a number of smaller time delayed grenades. Massive damage.
EMP: Makes an EMP/Electrical blast that damages Robots and power armour users, And causes fatigue damage and temporary paralysis to everyone!
Carpet: Explodes in midair when it detects a NPC or Creature within 15 feet, Scattering small bomblets everywhere! Massive area damage!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE.esm
Main ESM file, Contains all new ammo types, New ammo leveled lists, new ammo effects, etc.
Does not alter any existing records. CASE-Rebalance.esp does that to insure the overrides can be placed last in the load order.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE-Rebalance.esp
Needs CASE.esm
Alters existing ammo types and ammo list forms to conform with CASE
Needed to use new ammo types in weapons.
Alters all ammo boxes and case boxes to have a standard 100 rounds or cases.
Adds new recipes for Boxes of cases, To resell excessive ammo cases to NPC&apos;s
Increased Percent of empty cases recovered from most weapons/ammo types. Now its 30 to 40%.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leveled List Organizer.esm
Leveled List Organizer.esp
Leveled List Organizer.esp Must be last in load order, And should not be merged with other mods!
New leveled list resource for modders. Makes it MUCH easier to add new weapons to the game by sorting out and simplifying the leveled lists!
Restructuring of the leveled lists was done to more easily add weapons to factions, and know exactly where and what level they will show up, Resulting in a much cleaner and easier to edit selection of leveled lists, as well as easier to make mods inter-compatible, and easier to copy and paste additions from one faction/npc subtype to another in FNVedit, resulting in much less work overall to add a weapon to multiple leveled lists.
Rebalances most vendors to have much more ammo, and more relevant weapons and mods.
Rebalances most NPC&apos;s to spawn with more variation in weaponry. Many NPC&apos;s used to be hard coded to only use one weapon.
See included Leveled List Organizer.txt for more details and instructions on how to make your own LLO patches!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LLO-Merged Patch-Default.esp
Merged version of LLO-Partial Patch-CASE.esp + LLO-Base Patch-Overhaul.esp
Adds CASE ammo to NPC&apos;s and vendors and some chests.
200+ new ammo types, all purchasable and findable in chests and on defeated enemies.
Finally a fix for enemies and vendors not having all the various ammo types like HP/AP, Plus includes all the new CASE rounds!
Be warned! Some of the new ammo types are very powerful!
Typical 30% chance that a NPC will have a regular round, 70% that it will be a new CASE round!
Greatly increases ammo found on vendors of all types!
Alters ammo found to be much more random in quantity.
Premade Default merged patch when not using any other mods except CASE.
Only used ONE LLO-Merged patch-.esp at a time!

FAQ:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Is it Compatible with X?
A: CASE.esm adds totally new ammo and alters nothing, however to use that ammo, CASE-Rebalance.esp alters a number of form lists.
As such, CASE will likely not be compatible with other mods that add ammo without a merged patch. However it should be compatible with most other mods, Although mods that add weapons to NPC&apos;s typically won&apos;t spawn with the new CASE ammo, unless a dedicated patch has been made.
Currently, Classic Fallout Weapons has its own patch. Project Nevada has been tested by a user and no major conflicts found
If you find a conflict between this mod and another, Please leave a comment and I may attempt to fix it.
Leveled List Organizer alters a large number of leveled lists and will likely override other mods changes. It will work with other mods, but likely prevent them from adding items to NPCs unless a proper patch is made for that mod.
Q: Can I use CASE ammo in weapons another mod adds?
A: Yes!
Q: If I don&apos;t install &apos;Leveled List Organizer&apos;, How do I get the new CASE ammo?
A: Install craft pack and you will be able to craft it all from items already in the game.
Q: Is it Compatible with DLC?
A: Honest hearts has a patch to make it compatible and use the new .45 Auto ammo types. However I don&apos;t have GRA or Lonesome road yet, so I can not make patches for those DLC&apos;s. It should work fine with Dead Money and Old World Blues. Although new NPC&apos;s might not spawn with the new CASE ammo.
Q: I don&apos;t like ammo type X, Can you remove it?
A: No, However I have been considering making a &apos;Realistic&apos; version of the LLO-Partial Patch-CASE.esp plug-in, that would result in NPC&apos;s and vendors not having the more exotic ammo types. (Although craft pack could still be used to craft them), If you desire this, please leave a comment and tell me what ammo types you don&apos;t like.
Q: I found a bug
A: Please report it in the comments section, or as a private message to me. I love to get bug reports as finding a bug is most of the work needed to fix one. Even if it is something minor like a typo.
Q: The game stutters or lags when I use explosive ammo?
A: Explosion Stutter Fix, Highly recommended for less stutter

Module description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE.esm
Main ESM file, Contains all new ammo types, New ammo leveled lists, new ammo effects, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leveled List Organizer.esm
Leveled List Organizer.esp
Leveled List Organizer.esp Must be last in load order, And should not be merged with other mods!
New leveled list resource for modders. Makes it MUCH easier to add new weapons to the game by sorting out and simplifying the leveled lists!
Restructuring of the leveled lists was done to more easily add weapons to factions, and know exactly where and what level they will show up, Resulting in a much cleaner and easier to edit selection of leveled lists, as well as easier to make mods inter-compatible, and easier to copy and paste additions from one faction/npc subtype to another in FNVedit, resulting in much less work overall to add a weapon to multiple leveled lists.
Rebalances most vendors to have much more ammo, and more relevant weapons and mods.
Rebalances most NPC&apos;s to spawn with more variation in weaponry. Many NPC&apos;s used to be hard coded to only use one weapon.
See included Leveled List Organizer.txt for more details and instructions on how to make your own LLO patches!

FAQ:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Is it Compatible with X?
A: CASE.esm adds totally new ammo and alters nothing, however to use that ammo, CASE-Rebalance.esp alters a number of form lists.
As such, CASE will likely not be compatible with other mods that add ammo without a merged patch. However it should be compatible with most other mods, Although mods that add weapons to NPC&apos;s typically won&apos;t spawn with the new CASE ammo, unless a dedicated patch has been made.
Currently, Classic Fallout Weapons has its own patch. Project Nevada has been tested by a user and no major conflicts found
If you find a conflict between this mod and another, Please leave a comment and I may attempt to fix it.
Leveled List Organizer alters a large number of leveled lists and will likely override other mods changes. It will work with other mods, but likely prevent them from adding items to NPCs unless a proper patch is made for that mod.
Q: Can I use CASE ammo in weapons another mod adds?
A: Yes!
Q: If I don&apos;t install &apos;Leveled List Organizer&apos;, How do I get the new CASE ammo?
A: Install craft pack and you will be able to craft it all from items already in the game.
Q: Is it Compatible with DLC?
A: Honest hearts has a patch to make it compatible and use the new .45 Auto ammo types. However I don&apos;t have GRA or Lonesome road yet, so I can not make patches for those DLC&apos;s. It should work fine with Dead Money and Old World Blues. Although new NPC&apos;s might not spawn with the new CASE ammo.
Q: I don&apos;t like ammo type X, Can you remove it?
A: No, However I have been considering making a &apos;Realistic&apos; version of the LLO-Partial Patch-CASE.esp plug-in, that would result in NPC&apos;s and vendors not having the more exotic ammo types. (Although craft pack could still be used to craft them), If you desire this, please leave a comment and tell me what ammo types you don&apos;t like.
Q: I found a bug
A: Please report it in the comments section, or as a private message to me. I love to get bug reports as finding a bug is most of the work needed to fix one. Even if it is something minor like a typo.
Q: The game stutters or lags when I use explosive ammo?
A: Explosion Stutter Fix, Highly recommended for less stutter
